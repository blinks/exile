== The Colony
Ten thousand colonists left Earth for this class-M planet. Probes have been
here in orbit for decades mapping the surface, just like every other colony.
The colony ship dropped in to orbit the planet safely while supplies and people
were dropped off, but a stray asteroid killed that plan and half the colonists.

Now your ship lies in a heap of wreckage, somewhere on the planet, and you have
to build up a colony without many of the safeguards sent with you. You also have
the crew of the colony ship, who never wanted to stay.

== Best Laid Plans
The six plans, and how you trigger them:

- Explore: say where you're looking and what you hope to find.
- Gather: say where you're going and what you're collecting there.
- Build: say what you're building, where you're building it, and what materials you're using.
- Intervene: say what you're trying to prevent, and how.
- Repair: say what you're trying to fix, and how.
- Assault: say what you're trying to control, and how far you're willing to go.

After you make a plan, ask Gaia for position & effect. Each relevant resource
you add to your plan can either give you a die, improve your position, or
improve your effect, your choice. Key word: relevant. If you're looking to
repair the radio, it's highly unlikely that your diving gear will help.

(See https://bladesinthedark.com/action-roll for background.)

Write down the resources you add to your plan. To resolve a plan, confirm your
final position and effect, and confirm that your resources are available, and
roll. You get a die for each resource. (If you have no resources, you'll roll
two dice and reverse their order for the following.)

- The highest die determines how well the plan goes.
- The lowest die determines the stress you put on your resources, divided as
  evenly as you can among them. You choose what takes the extra stress.

Three possible playbooks for Gaia:

- The Wine Dark Sea (Subnautica-detailed ocean)
- City of Brass (ancient ruins of an alien city)
- Green Light (forest canopy, miles above the surface)

Playbooks would have threat moves and sorta be like an adventure starter.
Player exploration triggers Gaia's advancement (like the Cave in Vast), and the
playbook holds a food chain (as a pyramid) with space for habitat details (on
the left and right on each level).

City of Brass might end up with cyborg rodents somewhere in the middle, with a
sewer habitat linked to its level. Gaia doesn't name the flora / fauna, they
describe them and ask a player (whose character saw them) for a name.

A player's exploration plan must have a hope: something you really would like
to find. Lots of meat? A farm-able plant? A safe place to camp? The roll
decides whether or not you find it, and what the downsides are.

Gaia adds the results to the food chain / habitat map (perhaps on a 1-3 they
add whatever they want, on a crit they add exactly what the plan hoped for, and
on a 4-5 or 6 they add the plan's hopes plus some additional thing). As the map
fills up, Gaia advances, perhaps gaining access to new threats or moves.
(Perhaps they can only add a predator if it's supported by food underneath, and
habitats upwards as well.)

When the map fills up (or when players decide to strike out across the land?),
exploration allows Gaia to add a new playbook -- the players have gone far
enough out to find another biome.

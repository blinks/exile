== The basics
You've crash-landed in a colony ship on a far-away planet.  There are thousands
of surviving colonists out of tens-of-thousands who left on the journey.  The
captain calls together the leaders of the surviving factions to figure out what
to do.

This game takes place in the relative calm between storms.  Each session takes
place during the day of a face-to-face council meeting, and the time between
sessions is where those things happen, off-screen.

Like most role-playing games, you portray a character, with their own beliefs,
goals, and abilities.  Unlike most role-playing games, most of this one is
played physically.  If you want to leave the council room table, you get up and
leave it.  If you want to convince another character of something, you must
convince them.  The only things that you don't physically do are things that
could harm another player: once you commit to doing such a thing, the
facilitator (game's facilitator) tells you what happens based on your secret
attribute scores.

This all means that the game can become very personal -- make sure to call out
when the situation's getting too hot, or someone hits you where you're raw.
The group should keep an eye out for these situations, too.  No use wasting ten
minutes yelling at each other.  Move on.

If you notice a few people going at it verbally but making no progress, tell
them to either finish up or escalate to violence.  Sometimes it's difficult to
see when you're in that situation yourself.  It's alright for an argument to
end with no obvious winner -- this happens in real life all the time.
 
== Planetfall and beyond
Before each session, the facilitator needs to understand the situation so they
can prompt the other players.

- You should have a simple map, with the colony ship at the center, so players
  understand where they might find new resources and otherwise explore the
  world.  The initial map is just a bullseye, each ring divided into sections
  with a vague idea of what's there.
- You should have enough characters so that each player can take one, with none
  left over.  If you don't have enough, create some.  If you have too many,
  decide who's not coming to the meeting this session.  For the first session,
  use the Captain and enough other characters so everyone gets one.

=== You are the Captain.
You're getting older.  Though you're still respected in the corps, the
higher-ups are trying to get you "retired" to a desk job.  Crashing the ship
was the only way you'd be able to convince the corps to leave you here.  Shame
they got caught up in this.

- You believe that your name will be forgotten, or worse, remembered for your
  time in the war; planting a growing colony is the only way you'll get it
  remembered for the right reasons. 
- You believe that the corps are like family to you; you must get them out of
  here unscathed. 
- You believe that society must be built on rules and organization; you must
  make sure someone always has the final say in any given matter.
- You (and only you) have the three alpha-level codes for the ship: launch,
  self-destruct, and access to the armory.

=== You are the Merchant.
The guild sends all its members out on missions to open up new trade routes
properly, once they've hit a certain rank.  It's a loyalty test of sorts:
establish this new colony the way we want, and get advancement.  Of course,
it's supposed to be a temporary assignment.

- You believe that eventually a rescue party will come; you're going to need
  trade agreements (and guild protocol) set up before it comes, because they're
  certainly not sticking around to wait.
- You believe that the wealth of this planet will mostly come from discovery;
  you must set up favorable deals with the scientist to ensure the Guild gets
  exclusive, private access.
- You believe that the captain crashed the ship on purpose, to strand the
  prince here; you will find evidence to bring them to justice once you both
  get off-planet.
- You (and only you) have the authority to make agreements in the name of the
  guild.

=== You are the Prince
You tried to make a name for yourself with some clever maneuvering in the war,
but luck wasn't with you in those days.  As the third son, you were the
scapegoat for the rest of your family's crimes, and exiled for it.  Perhaps
this world is in need of your royal bloodline.

- You believe that only the nobility has the right to rule; you must take
  charge of these events before the peasantry makes a mess of them.
- You believe that the Guild is your one remaining link to home; you must get
  favorable agreements with them to regain your status with your house.
- You believe that the colony needs defenses, and having the corps here is a
  happy coincidence; you'll make sure the colony has a trained defense force
  ready before it's too late.
- You (and only you) have your saber, a family heirloom made out of a rare
  metal.

=== You are the Priestess
Before planetfall, you were a brave colonist, a generalist, a survivalist.
Now, you've seen the power of this planet and heard it call your own name.

- You believe that this world will eventually speak to everyone, if it isn't
  silenced; you must make sure the life here is treated with respect.
- You believe that the colony can survive through cooperating with the world;
  you must prevent the Guild from stripping its wealth away.
- You believe that the ship did enough damage in the crash; you must prevent it
  from ever launching again, to avoid the additional damage that would cause.
- You (and only you) can communicate (out loud) with an entity you call Gaia.
  Only you can hear her responses.

=== You are the Scientist
A whole unexplored world!  Even if tens of acres were destroyed in the crash,
there's millions more to be found and studied and written about.  As long as
you're given the freedom to work, and equipment to replace what was lost, you
should have several serious papers to distribute before the year is out.

- You believe that the ship's fumes are destroying the natural ecosystem; you
  must learn what you can before it's too-far altered by your presence.
- You believe that the colonists' new religion is a psychological defense
  mechanism; while unfortunate, you must not let it interfere with the
  important tasks of getting the colony up and running.
- You believe that the corps could be helpful in early exploration efforts; you
  must ensure some of that resource gets allocated to scientific endeavors.
- You (and only you) have the knowledge of how to repair the ship; you will
  likely need a rare metal to do anything useful there, though.

=== You are the Veteran
Ten years ago, the captain saved your life.  Now, the corps will save the
captain.

- You believe that the ship can be repaired; you must find someone capable of
  doing so and get them working on it soon, before the fuel decays too far.
- You believe that the captain is above reproach; you must protect their
  reputation from civilians who don't understand life in the corps.
- You believe that the prince deserves to be exiled here, after the pain his
  orders caused to your family; you won't let him escape that punishment.
- You (and only you) have a small scout ship, the only one to survive re-entry.

== The council room
The character who called this meeting sits at the table, and decides who else
to call in.  Other players may interrupt at their leisure, or plan and plot on
their own.

The captain called the first meeting.

=== Reading of the minutes.
At the beginning of each session, go over the situation so everyone remembers
what happened last time -- or in the first session, what _just_ happened.

=== Old business.
Based on the minutes, discuss the current situation and resolve any old
business.  Players may leave for break at any point, but may not return until
after the break.

In the first meeting, the colony must be given a name.  The corps thinks it
should be named after the captain.  A nascent religious group thinks it should
be named "Eldest."

=== Break.
Players have fifteen minutes to do private business.  The facilitator will wander
around to take notes and facilitate play.

=== New Business.
Players discuss what they should do, both individually and as a group.

=== Adjournment.
The character who called the meeting can adjourn it at any time, though that
doesn't end the session, only the meeting.  Each player may call for at most
one more scene to handle unfinished business, and then the session ends.

During play, the facilitator is walking around taking notes (questions,
ideas, events) for future prep.  Anything non-physical that happens during the
session is non-mechanized, so to convince someone you must convince them.
Anything physical is a look-up by the facilitator, based on the [secret] stats
of those involved.  At the end of the session, players will tell the facilitator what
they work on off-screen.

After the session, debrief with the group.  Talk about what happens in the time
to come, before the next meeting is called.  Come up with more problems and
opportunities, fill out the map some more, adjust beliefs as they're changed
through play, and tick clocks towards completion.

== Ludography
Standing on the shoulders of giants.  Not every inspiration is listed, of
course: some are totally unconscious.  Parallel development is also a thing.

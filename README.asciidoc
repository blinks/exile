= The basics

This is a game about the survivors of a fallen colony ship.  One player plays
as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis[Gaia], with her eyes and ears
on the planet itself, its flora and fauna, and the neutral colonists.  The rest
of the players lead factions that compete for control and power in _Exile_.

Your gaming group gathers for a few hours to play a session. During your first
session, you collaboratively describe the colony where the story is set; in
particular, the different desires that factions organize around.  Then you make
planetfall.

== Setting up to play
Get three to five people, including you.  One will play Gaia, the rest will
take control of colonists.  This is Gaia's playbook, so give it to her.

== The conversation
I'm going to quote D. Vincent Baker <<aw>> here and annotate it like a Zen
koan, if that's acceptable:

> You probably know this already: roleplaying is a conversation.  You and the
> other players go back and forth, talking about these fictional characters in
> their fictional circumstances doing whatever it is that they do.

Oddly for roleplaying games, _Exile_ make each player (not just Gaia)
responsible for multiple characters directly.  This is sometimes referred to as
"troupe play", from _Ars Magica_ <<ars>>.

> Like any conversation, you take turns, but it’s not like taking turns, right?
> Sometimes you talk over each other, interrupt, build on each others’ ideas,
> monopolize. All fine.

_Exile_ is about an alien planet.  It's strange.  If you leave all the details
of the planet up to Gaia, it'll be a kind of strange strongly flavored by her
experience alone.  Each player should contribute their own strange.  Strange
needs spice.

> All these rules do is mediate the conversation. They kick in when someone
> says some particular things, and they impose constraints on what everyone
> should say after. Makes sense, right?

Right.

== Sources of truth
As you play _Exile_, you'll be building a body of *truth* about the world of
the game and the people who inhabit it.

It's important to remember (especially if you come from other games) that there
are three main sources of truth:

. The players.  If someone says something and nobody argues, it's true.  Write
  it down.
. The dice.  If the rules are kicking in and dice are thrown, the rules will
  tell you what's true.  Write it down.
. The maps.  If something is already down on the map, it's true until it's
  crossed out.

Once something's true, don't waste time arguing it.  In Luke Crane's _Burning
Wheel_, this is called the *Let it Ride* rule:

> A player shall test once against an obstacle and shall not roll again until
> conditions legitimately and drastically change. <<bw>>

In _Exile_, this translates: the written truth is not something you can easily
argue.  If a guild wins a conflict intending to control all scientific output
from a society, they control it.  The society can't argue the matter until they
can legitimately and drastically change the situation.  Good luck.

== Faction creation

Pick something external that your colonist's faction is organized around,
perhaps a bloodline, wealth, or a shared belief system.  Take the associated
playbook.

Oh, playbooks: A playbook is an archetypical description, a guide for the
creation of a faction.  Each playbook paints a faction in broad strokes,
differentiating them through playbook-specific moves.  Each playbook pushes a
theme that you build upon and explore in play.

The playbooks in _Exile_ are:

* The *Artificium*, a faction of newly-sentient robots.
* The *Corps*, accidental colonists.
* The *Guild*, merchants tied together by wealth and shared interests.
* The *Hermit*, a solitary soul who needs the colony to survive.
* The *House*, an aristocracy tied together by bloodline.
* The *Religion*, a congregation tied together by a shared belief.
* The *Society*, tied together by curiosity and a desire for knowledge.

Each playbook has a set of characters that you start with.  Name them.

=== Artificium
Before the fall, robots assisted in (or performed) all colony ship duties.  As
the trip wore on, their neural networks started to develop what some in the
Society would term _consciousness_.

Look:: How can a colonist tell if someone's a robot?
Characters:: a philosopher, a guard, a cleaner.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

=== Corps
You never asked for this.  It was supposed to be a one-term job, nicely
lucrative, and then retirement at home, where you belong.  No such luck, I
guess.  Better hole up and hope another wave comes to investigate.

Look:: What weapon is every member trained in?
Characters:: an officer, a veteran, a greenie.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

=== Guild
Tied together by wealth, a Guild is fickle.  Produce, and you're on top of
the world.  Just make sure your well doesn't dry up.

Look:: What's the resource you control, and how does that feature on your
sigil?
Characters:: a boss, an accountant, an enforcer.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

=== Hermit
You came to escape.  Just you, by yourself.  Good luck.

Look:: What do the colonists notice first about you, and use to label you --
none of them knows your real name.
Characters:: a hermit.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

=== House
Tied together by bloodline, it's difficult to be accepted in a House that you
aren't born into.  After planetfall, the house might just need all the help it
can get.

Look:: What physical features do all the people of your house share?
Characters:: a matriarch or patriarch, an heir, a trusted friend.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

=== Religion
Tied together by belief, a Religion offers hope for the hopeless.
Unfortunately, how do you know what's solid ground on in a strange planet?

Look:: What symbol do you wear to show your affiliation?
Characters:: a priest, an acolyte, a layman.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

=== Society
Tied together by curiosity, which is the loosest bond of all.  Sometimes it
pays off.  Sometimes you breathe ether.

Look:: What type of clothing shows your membership of the society?
Characters:: a scientist, an engineer, an explorer.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

== Planetfall

. Draw an X in the middle of your map.  This is the crash site.
. Your ship is ripped open by the crash, and the planet's air rushes in --
  fortunately breathable.  Gaia should describe the feel of it (how hot or
  cold, dry or wet, how it smells or tastes).
. Something on the ship is now broken beyond repair. Choose or draw:
** Coins: The food replication and water recycling systems were both
   destroyed.  You were just about to grab a bite, too.  [Changes the
   starvation move?]
** Wands: Sparks fly from the computer system, which held all of ancient
   Earth's knowledge.  [Changes the invent move?]
** Cups: The landing wasn't gentle enough for the medical supplies, which are
   now impossible to salvage.  [Changes the gather move?]
** Swords: The armory destroys itself in a massive explosion.  You'll have to
   rely on primitive weapons.  [Changes the hunt move?]
. Deal cards until each player has five.
. Ask who's in charge.

NOTE: TODO: Other planetfall questions, like a built-in adventure starter.

= Play
image::img/salvage.png[]

== Survival

Salvage:: When you delve into the ship for supplies, describe what you're
looking for, who's on the salvage operation, and draw, one card at a time.
With each card, Gaia will ask you a question about what you find in the ship
and what it means.  You may stop drawing whenever you want.

If you go over 21 (Aces count as 1 or 11, your choice), Gaia will describe what
happens.  Either way, Gaia will tick the ship's salvage countdown -- when it's
full, nothing else can be usefully gotten from the ship.

TIP: Play _Dread_.  No, seriously.

Gather:: When you gather the planet's flora, describe your gathering party and
draw a card.  Gaia will ask you two questions about the region:

* What kind of plants grow in this region?
* What kind of animal sounds do you hear?
* What does the region's terrain look like?
* What do you see on the horizon?

She'll write down the answers and then do something off-screen.

Hunt:: When you hunt the planet's fauna, describe your hunting party and commit
one or more cards.  Choose how many cards Gaia will commit.  For each, she will
ask a question about the fauna you hunt:

* What do they look/sound/smell like?
* Aside from you, what hunts them?
* What do they eat?
* How do they protect themselves?

Reveal all committed cards.  If you win, take Gaia's cards and keep your own --
describe how you were successful.  If you lose, Gaia will describe what
happens.

Invent:: When you use the planet's resources for your own purpose, tell Gaia
what you're trying to achieve.  Gaia will give you one to four of the following
conditions:

* It's going to take days/weeks/months
* First you'll have to get/build/fix/figure out __
* You'll need help from __
* It will require a massive harvest of resources
* The best you can do is a simpler version, unreliable and limited
* You'll have to take __ apart to do it

TIP: Take a look at _Apocalypse World_ and Savvyhead's workspace, or _Dungeon
World_ and the Wizard's ritual.

== Conflict

All interested factions describe how they're involved and ante up by committing
a card.

NOTE: "Commit" means to place a card from your hand face-down on the table.
_Cards are not linked to specific characters_: If the King of Spades is
Historian Sarah in one conflict, it can be Soldier Anne in the next.  Your
cards act as a limit on what your faction can do.

Once everyone has anted, players take turns choosing one of the following
options, until there is no further escalation:

Raise:: You escalate, turning the tables on your adversary.  Commit another
card, and describe what new resources you bring to bear.
Call:: You counter, stopping your adversary in their tracks.  Describe how
you're holding out with your current resources.
Fold:: You relent, accepting the consequences as established.  Once you fold,
you forfeit the opportunity to call or raise even if the conflict continues.
You are no longer a factor until after the conflict has resolved.

If only one faction is left after escalation ends, they keep their committed
cards without revealing them.

If multiple factions are left after escalation ends, they simultaneously reveal
all committed cards.  Players may then grant cards to one another to improve
the situation, but all committed cards stay committed.

The highest poker hand wins, and achieves their intent.  The winner decides the
fate of each character, but that character's player decides how they arrive at
that fate.  All committed cards are discarded.

Starvation:: At the end of a conflict, if you have fewer cards in your hand
than named characters in your faction, choose a character: Gaia decides their
fate.  Draw a card.

Write down the fate of your characters on your faction sheet.  Cross out the
names of those who have died.  If all your characters have died, your faction
is in danger of disappearing: reveal your hand, and compare it to a card Gaia
draws from the deck.

If your hand beats Gaia's, your faction survives: create a new character for
the first character role on your playbook, and describe how they pull the
faction back from oblivion.  If not, your faction disappears, describe how the
remaining members reassimilate into the colony.

TIP: Take a look at _Dungeon World_ and the Last Breath move.

When a faction disappears, it's a good time to take a quick break, decide
whether you want to switch player roles (perhaps someone who just lost their
faction wants to play Gaia), and potentially create a new faction to fill the
hole.

= Gaia
image::img/planetfall-bw.png[]

This is your planet, Gaia.  These are your rules.

== Why you play the game

* Make your planet alien and strange.
* Make the colony's lives interesting.
* Play to find out what happens.

You aren't a neutral player in _Exile_.  Everything you say, you should aim to
accomplish these things.  Intentionally missing from this list: controlling the
factions, controlling the outcomes, driving a pre-planned storyline.  _Exile_,
like many roleplaying games, works best when you get to see everyone's plans
crash head-on into everyone else's plans at full speed.

The reward for this style of play is the experience of seeing a new kind of
strangeness emerge from the group as a whole.

== Whenever you speak

Speak to your principles:

* Keep your planet in flux.
* Address yourself to the colonists, not the players.
* Make your move, but misdirect.
* Make your move, but never speak its name.
* Look through crosshairs.
* Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
* Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.
* Be a fan of the colony.
* Think offscreen, too.
* Sometimes, ask the colonists.

Keep your planet in flux.::
Climate, terrain, flora, fauna.  Not a day should go by without the colony
seeing something new on your planet.  One day, a herd of enormous beasts
passes, and the microquakes of their steps threatens to collapse the wreckage
of the ship.  Another day, colonists wake to find the nearby grassland in
bloom, painted with neon color.  A ridge emerges from the previously-flat
terrain.  A fine mist of water drenches everything on contact.

Address yourself to the colonists, not the players.:: TODO

Make your move, but misdirect.:: TODO

Make your move, but never speak its name.:: TODO

Look through crosshairs.:: TODO

Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.:: TODO

Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.:: TODO

Be a fan of the colony.:: TODO

Think offscreen, too.:: TODO

Sometimes, ask the colonists.:: TODO

== In the moment

Whenever the other players look at you to say something, choose one of these
things and make it happen.

* Separate a faction.
* Bring several factions together.
* Injure a colonist (as established).
* Kill a colonist (as established).
* Show side-effects of the colony's growth. 
* Announce off-screen badness.
* Announce future badness.
* Take away their stuff.
* Demonstrate the downside of their stuff.
* Give them a difficult decision.
* Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
* Turn their move back on them.
* Make a move from the flora, fauna, climate, or terrain.
* After every move: "what do you do?"

These are just what they look like, don't read too much into them.  When you
make one of these things happen, it's the truth.  If a colonist is killed,
for example, cross them out.

Remember the principles.  Misdirect.  Never speak your move's name.  Keep your
planet alien and strange.

Choose moves that follow logically from what's going on.  There might be
several, and you can make things stretch a bit, but it has to make sense in
context.

Use your moves to threaten more than execute.  Give the colonists a chance to
act.  However, when they've had their chance, be irrevocable.  When they make a
move and it tells you to say what happens, they've had their chance.  When
you've been setting up a threat and they don't interfere, that's their chance
gone, too.

Badness, whether off-screen or future, is a good way to threaten.

____
The sandstorm is pretty much all you can see on the horizon of the grasslands.
It's closer than before -- what do you do?

You feel a quake, then another.  You hear a creak from the wreckage.  What do
you do?

The fire destroyed pretty much the entire forest; doesn't look like there's
much food left out there, and everything that could run, did.  What do you do?

She says if you don't deal with the thief, she'll deal with him herself.  What
do you do?

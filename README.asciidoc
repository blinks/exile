= The basics

This is a game about the survivors of a fallen colony ship.  One player plays
as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis[Gaia], with her eyes and ears
on the planet itself, its flora and fauna, and the neutral colonists.  The rest
of the players lead factions that compete for control and power in _Exile_.

NOTE: For now, we'll just use the normal AW 2d6 roll for a core mechanism, with
      10+ = yes, and; 7-9 = yes, but; 6- = no, and.

== Factions

* The *Artificium*, a faction of newly-sentient robots.
* The *Corps*, accidental colonists.
* The *Guild*, merchants tied together by wealth and shared interests.
* The *Hermit*, a solitary soul who needs the colony to survive.
* The *House*, an aristocracy tied together by bloodline.
* The *Religion*, a congregation tied together by a shared belief.
* The *Society*, tied together by curiosity and a desire for knowledge.

=== Artificium
Before the fall, robots assisted in (or performed) all colony ship duties.  As
the trip wore on, their neural networks started to develop what some in the
Society would term _consciousness_.

Look:: How can a colonist tell if someone's a robot?
Characters:: a philosopher, a guard, a cleaner.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

=== Corps
You never asked for this.  It was supposed to be a one-term job, nicely
lucrative, and then retirement at home, where you belong.  No such luck, I
guess.  Better hole up and hope another wave comes to investigate.

Look:: What weapon is every member trained in?
Characters:: an officer, a veteran, a greenie.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

=== Guild
Tied together by wealth, a Guild is fickle.  Produce, and you're on top of
the world.  Just make sure your well doesn't dry up.

Look:: What's the resource you control, and how does that feature on your
sigil?
Characters:: a boss, an accountant, an enforcer.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

=== Hermit
You came to escape.  Just you, by yourself.  Good luck.

Look:: What do the colonists notice first about you, and use to label you --
none of them knows your real name.
Characters:: a hermit.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

=== House
Tied together by bloodline, it's difficult to be accepted in a House that you
aren't born into.  After planetfall, the house might just need all the help it
can get.

Look:: What physical features do all the people of your house share?
Characters:: a matriarch or patriarch, an heir, a trusted friend.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

=== Religion
Tied together by belief, a Religion offers hope for the hopeless.
Unfortunately, how do you know what's solid ground on in a strange planet?

Look:: What symbol do you wear to show your affiliation?
Characters:: a priest, an acolyte, a layman.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

=== Society
Tied together by curiosity, which is the loosest bond of all.  Sometimes it
pays off.  Sometimes you breathe ether.

Look:: What type of clothing shows your membership of the society?
Characters:: a scientist, an engineer, an explorer.

NOTE: TODO: Playbook questions, including bonds.

== Planetfall

. Draw an X in the middle of your map.  This is the crash site.
. Talk about what you notice on the new planet: sights, smells, sounds, flora,
  fauna, the weather, the landscape.  Get about twenty of these first
  impressions on paper.  Gaia should press for details to make sure everyone's
  on the same page, and flesh the world out even further.

* TODO: Planetfall questions, like a built-in adventure starter.
* TODO: "Dungeon generator" for the crashed ship (complete w/"magic" items).
* TODO: "Perilous Wilds" exploration for the planet (flora, fauna, etc.).
* TODO: Colony clock; filled in and it dies. Like AW Fundamental Scarcity.

== Survival

Invent:: When you use the planet's resources for your own purpose, tell Gaia
what you're trying to achieve.  Gaia will give you one to four of the following
conditions:

* It's going to take days/weeks/months
* First you'll have to get/build/fix/figure out __
* You'll need help from __
* It will require a massive harvest of resources
* The best you can do is a simpler version, unreliable and limited
* You'll have to take __ apart to do it

= Gaia

This is your planet, Gaia.  These are your rules.

== Why you play the game

* Make your planet alien and strange.
* Make the colony's lives interesting.
* Play to find out what happens.

You aren't a neutral player in _Exile_.  Everything you say, you should aim to
accomplish these things.  Intentionally missing from this list: controlling the
factions, controlling the outcomes, driving a pre-planned storyline.  _Exile_,
like many roleplaying games, works best when you get to see everyone's plans
crash head-on into everyone else's plans at full speed.

The reward for this style of play is the experience of seeing a new kind of
strangeness emerge from the group as a whole.

== Whenever you speak

Speak to your principles:

* Keep your planet in flux.
* Address yourself to the colonists, not the players.
* Make your move, but misdirect.
* Make your move, but never speak its name.
* Look through crosshairs.
* Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
* Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.
* Be a fan of the colony.
* Think offscreen, too.
* Sometimes, ask the colonists.

Keep your planet in flux.::
Climate, terrain, flora, fauna.  Not a day should go by without the colony
seeing something new on your planet.  One day, a herd of enormous beasts
passes, and the microquakes of their steps threatens to collapse the wreckage
of the ship.  Another day, colonists wake to find the nearby grassland in
bloom, painted with neon color.  A ridge emerges from the previously-flat
terrain.  A fine mist of water drenches everything on contact.

Address yourself to the colonists, not the players.:: TODO

Make your move, but misdirect.:: TODO

Make your move, but never speak its name.:: TODO

Look through crosshairs.:: TODO

Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.:: TODO

Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.:: TODO

Be a fan of the colony.:: TODO

Think offscreen, too.:: TODO

Sometimes, ask the colonists.:: TODO

== In the moment

Whenever the other players look at you to say something, choose one of these
things and make it happen.

* Separate a faction.
* Bring several factions together.
* Injure a colonist (as established).
* Kill a colonist (as established).
* Show side-effects of the colony's growth. 
* Announce off-screen badness.
* Announce future badness.
* Take away their stuff.
* Demonstrate the downside of their stuff.
* Give them a difficult decision.
* Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
* Turn their move back on them.
* Make a move from the flora, fauna, climate, or terrain.
* After every move: "what do you do?"

These are just what they look like, don't read too much into them.  When you
make one of these things happen, it's the truth.  If a colonist is killed,
for example, cross them out.

Remember the principles.  Misdirect.  Never speak your move's name.  Keep your
planet alien and strange.

Choose moves that follow logically from what's going on.  There might be
several, and you can make things stretch a bit, but it has to make sense in
context.

Use your moves to threaten more than execute.  Give the colonists a chance to
act.  However, when they've had their chance, be irrevocable.  When they make a
move and it tells you to say what happens, they've had their chance.  When
you've been setting up a threat and they don't interfere, that's their chance
gone, too.

Badness, whether off-screen or future, is a good way to threaten.

____
The sandstorm is pretty much all you can see on the horizon of the grasslands.
It's closer than before -- what do you do?

You feel a quake, then another.  You hear a creak from the wreckage.  What do
you do?

The fire destroyed pretty much the entire forest; doesn't look like there's
much food left out there, and everything that could run, did.  What do you do?

She says if you don't deal with the thief, she'll deal with him herself.  What
do you do?

Standing on the shoulders of giants.  Not every inspiration is listed, of
course: some are totally unconscious.  Parallel development is also a thing.

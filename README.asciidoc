= The basics
This is a story about the survivors of a fallen colony ship.  One of you plays
as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis[Gaia], with her eyes and ears
on the planet itself, its flora and fauna, and the colony.  The rest of you
play colonists, hoping to survive together.

== What is this thing?
Exile isn't quite a "game" in the normal sense -- nobody's attempting to win,
and losing a character doesn't lose you the game or anything.  It's more like
a structured way to play pretend.  We hand the reins of the experience over to
Gaia, and the other players build characters to control like they're piloting
a mech suit.

The nice thing about this is that we can avoid the old cops and robbers
argument of "I shot you!" "No, you didn't!" because someone's in charge of
deciding what happens at any given point.  It's not that much fun to always
just decide, though, so we'll often push it off to the dice.  The dice don't
feel as bad when things go poorly, so that's a bonus.  Stories where only good
things happen are seldom interesting.

Another nice thing about playing with a group of creative people is that nobody
has to come up with everything themselves.  Creativity is draining, especially
building a whole world up from nothing.  Sometimes you can make someone else
create, or use the rules and tables in this book to prompt you.

== Secrets
There are no secrets in Exile.  Either everyone at the table knows, or nobody
knows.  Hard and fast rule.

This means no character backstory that doesn't emerge from play.  It means no
building a world map on your own and then springing it on the other players.
It means don't write up the alien planet bird-watching book and consult it
when someone looks outside.

It also means you can't have secret plans that only you and Gaia know about,
springing them on the others only after completion.  Air those things out,
folks.

== The colony
In a way, the colony is fortunate: this was the planet you set out to find, and
so it has breathable air, reasonable gravitational forces, and drinkable water.
You were never meant to return to Earth, so it's not like losing a viable
starship changes much.

This story is not about colony in-fighting, though that may happen.  Neither is
it about player-vs-player conflict.  No player's character is going to be an
antagonist here.  The planet is enough of one.  If an antagonist arises from
within the colony, Gaia will figure out what they do.  Players are on the same
team.

== Scenes
Exile is played over a sequence of scenes, like a movie.  Between scenes is
a blank space for everyone to discuss plans, think through options, grab
snacks.  When there's an obvious next step, Gaia will open a scene to handle
that next step.

Keep scenes as focused as possible, and end them when they go unfocused.

Gaia opens a scene by bringing a character or two in to play, and either says
what's going on or asks a player.  When the core of that scene is resolved, or
it goes unfocused, Gaia will close it out.

Sometimes -- but not always -- one scene naturally leads into another.  Gaia
should feel free to cut from scene to scene immediately, without blank space.
Give everyone a chance to rest, though.  Continuous storytelling is exhausting.

= Colonists
To create a colonist, pick a playbook and roll four six-sided dice (4d6).
Assign these dice to the four colonist attributes:

- Mind: intelligence, wisdom, ability to learn, etc.
- Body: strength, dexterity, constitution, etc.
- Spirit: charisma, morale, emotional intelligence, etc.
- Sense: sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste, etc.

In play, you'll be forming pools of dice based on these attributes and rolling
them, looking for 5s and 6s: hits.  The more hits, the better.  With no hits,
your life is in Gaia's hands.  Rolling in Exile only happens for big things,
too -- instead of rolling ten times for a fight scene, you should only be
rolling once or (at most) twice.

Choose one of the roles, and be ready to play out your planetfall scene.

== Playbooks

=== The Artificium, a faction of newly-sentient robots.
Before the fall, robots assisted in (or performed) all colony ship duties.  As
the trip wore on, their neural networks started to develop what some in the
Society would term _consciousness_.

Roles:: a philosopher, a guard, a cleaner.
Look:: How can a colonist tell if someone's a robot?
Scene:: In the pitch-blackness of the ship, what do you hear?

=== The Corps, accidental colonists.
You never asked for this.  It was supposed to be a one-term job, nicely
lucrative, and then retirement at home, where you belong.  No such luck, I
guess.  Better hole up and hope another wave comes to investigate.

Roles:: an officer, a veteran, a greenie.
Look:: What weapon is every member trained in?
Scene:: Fade in to a room with no survivors, what do you see?

=== The Guild, merchants tied together by wealth and shared interests.
Tied together by wealth, a Guild is fickle.  Produce, and you're on top of the
world.  Just make sure your well doesn't dry up.

Roles:: a boss, an accountant, an enforcer.
Look:: What's the resource you control, and how does that feature on your
       sigil?
Scene:: Zoom out from a conference table, what are you arguing about?

=== The Hermit, a solitary soul who needs the colony to survive.
You came to escape.  Just you, by yourself.  Good luck.

Roles:: monastic, artistic, solitary.
Look:: What do the colonists notice first about you, and use to label you?
       (None of them knows your real name.)
Scene:: Cut to yelling over a roaring fire, what do you do?

=== The House, an aristocracy tied together by bloodline.
Tied together by bloodline, it's difficult to be accepted in a House that you
aren't born into.  After planetfall, the house might just need all the help it
can get.

Roles:: a matriarch or patriarch, an heir, a trusted friend.
Look:: What physical features do all the people of your house share?
Scene:: Pan up from the floor, covered in rubble. What heirloom do you find? 

=== The Religion, a congregation tied together by a shared belief.
Tied together by belief, a Religion offers hope for the hopeless.
Unfortunately, how do you know what's solid ground on in a strange planet?

Roles:: a priest, an acolyte, a layman.
Look:: What symbol do you wear to show your affiliation?
Scene:: Fade in to the first light from the planet, what color is it?

=== The Society, tied together by curiosity and a desire for knowledge.
Tied together by curiosity, which is the loosest bond of all.  Sometimes it
pays off.  Sometimes you breathe ether.

Roles:: a scientist, an engineer, an explorer.
Look:: What type of clothing shows your membership of the society?
Scene:: The planet's air blows through a gash in the hull, what do you smell?

= Planetfall
Get out a piece of blank white paper and draw a bullseye on it.  In the center
is your crash site.

Each player in turn should decide what their character was before planetfall by
picking a playbook and a role, and then play out the associated scene.

Play the scene for a minute or two, enough to show the character, the broken
ship, the planet, and then cut.  You don't need to show every second of life in
the aftermath of planetfall, this is more of a montage.  After each scene,
players should consider their immediate priorities and write one down as a
goal.

When the introductory scenes are done, everyone should have answered for their
playbook's look, and come up with their character's goal.  In the blank space
after the last introductory scene, decide where to fade in.

= Play
Most of play is just conversation.  People talk about what they do, and what
happens when they do it.  Don't worry about the minutia -- anything you
wouldn't see in the movies shouldn't be bothered with here.  Batman doesn't
ride the bus to the crime scene, he just shows up.

Sometimes, a character will do something, and you can just hear the soundtrack
picking up.  Generally, that means it's time to roll the dice.  I've got a
few of these times listed below, and then I'll talk about what to do when you
obviously need to roll the dice, but the situation isn't in the book.

In Powered by the Apocalypse games, these are called *moves.*  Read them in
three parts:

1. *The trigger:* When this happens in the fiction, get ready to roll!  In
   particular, if this _doesn't_ happen, _don't roll._
2. *The success:* "On a hit" means you rolled at least one 5 or 6.  This is
   what the roll is deciding at its core.  If you don't actually care about
   this, you probably aren't actually triggering the move.  Step back and
   re-evaluate.  On a miss, of course, you don't get this.
3. *The options:* Help everyone understand what's at stake here before you
   roll, so everyone's on the same page.  Perhaps you don't care how long it
   takes, but you've got to be rested when you get there.  This is what the
   options are for.  You can choose a few, but if you don't roll as many hits
   as options picked, Gaia can throw in some chaos.

== Basic Moves

When you *remember where something important was on the ship,* name it and
choose at least one, then roll mind.  On a hit, you know where it is.
- it's close to you
- you know a secret way
- you have the access codes 

When you *make your way to an interesting place,* find (or draw) it on the map
and choose at least one, then roll body.  On a hit, you get there.  If it isn’t
named, name it.
- it doesn’t take much time
- nobody / nothing notices you
- you’re not worn out by the trip

When you *look for something useful nearby,* name it and choose at least one,
then roll senses.  On a hit, you find it.
- it’s in perfect repair
- it’s hard to break
- nobody else wants it right now

When you *give orders to the colonists,* say what they are and choose at least
one, then roll spirit.  On a hit, they do what you say.
- they jump to it
- they’re experienced at this kind of thing
- nobody takes offense

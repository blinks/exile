== The basics
You've crash-landed in a colony ship on a far-away planet.  There are thousands
of surviving colonists out of tens-of-thousands who left on the journey.  The
captain calls together the leaders of the surviving factions to figure out what
to do.

This game takes place in the relative calm between storms.  Each session takes
place during the day of a face-to-face council meeting, and the time between
sessions is where those things happen, off-screen.

Like most role-playing games, you portray a character, with their own beliefs,
goals, and abilities.  Unlike most role-playing games, most of this one is
played physically.  If you want to leave the council room table, you get up and
leave it.  If you want to convince another character of something, you must
convince them.  The only things that you don't physically do are things that
could harm another player: once you commit to doing such a thing, the
facilitator tells you what happens based on your secret attribute scores.

This all means that the game can become very personal -- make sure to call out
when the situation's getting too hot, or someone hits you where you're raw.
The group should keep an eye out for these situations, too.  No use wasting ten
minutes yelling at each other.  Move on.

If you notice a few people going at it verbally but making no progress, tell
them to either finish up or escalate to violence.  Sometimes it's difficult to
see when you're in that situation yourself.  It's alright for an argument to
end with no obvious winner -- this happens in real life all the time.
 
=== Prep
Before each session, the facilitator needs to understand the situation so they
can prompt the other players.

- You should have a simple map, with the colony ship at the center, so players
  understand where they might find new resources and otherwise explore the
  world.  The initial map is just a bullseye, each ring divided into sections
  with a vague idea of what's there.
- You should have at least three time-sensitive problems or opportunities that
  can be stated concisely.  These should be obvious to at least one player, but
  don't need to be obvious to everyone.  Make Blades-style clocks for each one
  to emphasize that time is running out.
- You should have enough characters so that each player can take one, with none
  left over.  If you don't have enough, create some.  If you have too many,
  decide who's not coming to the meeting this session.

For the first session,...

- The captain sustained major injuries, and will likely die from them
  [8-clock].
- The ship's colonization supplies were damaged in the crash, and might not
  give us enough time to become self-sustaining [6-clock].
- The ship itself is becoming more dangerous; the thrusters were never supposed
  to enter the atmosphere, and their environmental impact is unknown [4-clock].

The characters in the first session:  (TODO: beliefs + goals, randomly draw abilities)

- The Captain: Secretly intended to crash the ship, Cortez-style, but didn’t
  mean to strand the corps here. Wants to impose military order with himself at
  the head.
- The Merchant: An ambassador of sorts from the Guild, to set up interstellar
  trade routes; current situation means they better start smaller, but it’d be
  nice to ship off-planet.
- The Prince: Third son, forced into exile to save his family some
  embarrassment -— but here, he’s certainly the senior heir.
- The Priestess: Planetfall gave her a brief moment of enlightenment, and she
  thinks Gaia is calling her to start a new religion.  She might be right.
- The Scientist: A whole new world to explore and learn about, and a small pond
  for them to be a big fish in.
- The Veteran: Stranded here on accident, she thinks the ship can be repaired
  enough to get at least some people back into the black.

=== Session
. Dawn. (Free play, wandering time, clerk seeds everyone with recent issues
  and opportunities.)
. Day. (If anyone wants to call for scenes, they can do so.)
. Dusk. (The meeting. Where is it? Who calls it to order?  Who’s supposed to
  be there?  Who’s there anyway?  What do they decide?)

During play, the clerk (facilitator) is walking around taking notes (questions,
ideas, events) for future prep.  Anything non-physical that happens during the
session is non-mechanized, so to convince someone you must convince them.
Anything physical is a look-up by the facilitator, based on the [secret] stats
of those involved.  At the end of the session, players will tell the clerk what
they work on off-screen.

After the session, debrief with the group.  Talk about what happens in the week
to come, before the next meeting is called.  Come up with more problems and
opportunities, fill out the map some more, adjust beliefs as they're changed
through play, and tick clocks towards completion.

== Ludography
Standing on the shoulders of giants.  Not every inspiration is listed, of
course: some are totally unconscious.  Parallel development is also a thing.

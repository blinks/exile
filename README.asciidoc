== The basics
You've crash-landed in a colony ship on a far-away planet.  There are thousands
of surviving colonists out of tens-of-thousands who left on the journey.  The
captain calls together the leaders of the surviving factions to figure out what
to do.

This game takes place in the relative calm between storms.  Each session takes
place during the day of a face-to-face council meeting, and the time between
sessions is where those things happen, off-screen.

Like most role-playing games, you portray a character, with their own beliefs,
goals, and abilities.  Unlike most role-playing games, most of this one is
played physically.  If you want to leave the council room table, you get up and
leave it.  If you want to convince another character of something, you must
convince them.  The only things that you don't physically do are things that
could harm another player: once you commit to doing such a thing, the
facilitator tells you what happens based on your secret attribute scores.

This all means that the game can become very personal -- make sure to call out
when the situation's getting too hot, or someone hits you where you're raw.
The group should keep an eye out for these situations, too.  No use wasting ten
minutes yelling at each other.  Move on.

If you notice a few people going at it verbally but making no progress, tell
them to either finish up or escalate to violence.  Sometimes it's difficult to
see when you're in that situation yourself.  It's alright for an argument to
end with no obvious winner -- this happens in real life all the time.
 
=== Prep
Before each session, the facilitator needs to understand the situation so they
can prompt the other players.

- You should have a simple map, with the colony ship at the center, so players
  understand where they might find new resources and otherwise explore the
  world.  The initial map is just a bullseye, each ring divided into sections
  with a vague idea of what's there.
- You should have at least three time-sensitive problems or opportunities that
  can be stated concisely.  These should be obvious to at least one player, but
  don't need to be obvious to everyone.  Make Blades-style clocks for each one
  to emphasize that time is running out.
- You should have enough characters so that each player can take one, with none
  left over.  If you don't have enough, create some.  If you have too many,
  decide who's not coming to the meeting this session.

For the first session,...

- The captain sustained major injuries, and will likely die from them
  [8-clock].
- The ship's colonization supplies were damaged in the crash, and might not
  give us enough time to become self-sustaining [6-clock].
- The ship itself is becoming more dangerous; the thrusters were never supposed
  to enter the atmosphere, and their environmental impact is unknown [4-clock].

For the first session, use the Captain and enough other characters so everyone
gets one.

=== You are the Captain.
You're getting older.  Though you're still respected in the corps, the
higher-ups are trying to get you "retired" to a desk job.  Crashing the ship
was the only way you'd be able to convince the corps to leave you here.  Shame
they got caught up in this.

- You believe that your name will be forgotten, or worse, remembered for your
  time in the war; planting a growing colony is the only way you'll get it
  remembered for the right reasons. 
- You believe that the corps are like family to you; you must get them out of
  here unscathed. 
- You believe that society must be built on rules and organization; you must
  make sure someone always has the final say in any given matter.
- You (and only you) have the three alpha-level codes for the ship: launch,
  self-destruct, and access to the armory.

=== You are the Merchant.
The guild sends all its members out on missions to open up new trade routes
properly, once they've hit a certain rank.  It's a loyalty test of sorts:
establish this new colony the way we want, and get advancement.  Of course,
it's supposed to be a temporary assignment.

- You believe that eventually a rescue party will come; you're going to need
  trade agreements (and guild protocol) set up before it comes, because they're
  certainly not sticking around to wait.
- You believe that the wealth of this planet will mostly come from discovery;
  you must set up favorable deals with the scientist to ensure the Guild gets
  exclusive, private access.
- You believe that ...
- You (and only you) have ...

- The Prince: Third son, forced into exile to save his family some
  embarrassment -— but here, he’s certainly the senior heir.
- The Priestess: Planetfall gave her a brief moment of enlightenment, and she
  thinks Gaia is calling her to start a new religion.  She might be right.
- The Scientist: A whole new world to explore and learn about, and a small pond
  for them to be a big fish in.

=== You are the Veteran
Stranded here on accident, she thinks the ship can be repaired enough to get at
least some people back into the black.

== Session

=== Reading and approval of the minutes.
At the beginning of each session, go over the situation so everyone remembers
what happened last time -- or in the first session, what _just_ happened.

=== Reports of Officers, Boards, Standing Committees.
The facilitator should distribute all the off-screen results to players who
know about them, who can then describe what happened.  They should have a ton
of leeway here.

=== Reports of Special Committees.
(Each report could conclude with a motion which the assembly must address.)

=== Special Orders.
(Any motion which was adopted as a Special Order which guarantees that the motion will be dealt with before the meeting is adjourned.)

=== Unfinished Business and General Orders.
(Any issue which was not concluded, was postponed, or was tabled during the prior meeting. The secretary's minutes should inform the chair which items to add to this section. Only a clueless chair would ask the assembly, 'Is there any unfinished business?')

=== New Business.
(This is when the chair and the parliamentarian can be surprised by the sequence of events. It is best to always anticipate issues the membership may present, or else be embarrassed by the complications.
It is at this time that announcements, educational programs, and speakers are introduced.)

=== Adjournment.
(A motion to adjourn may be made at any time of the meeting. The assembly should never be forced to meet longer than it is willing to meet.)


. Dawn. (Free play, wandering time, clerk seeds everyone with recent issues
  and opportunities.)
. Day. (If anyone wants to call for scenes, they can do so.)
. Dusk. (The meeting. Where is it? Who calls it to order?  Who’s supposed to
  be there?  Who’s there anyway?  What do they decide?)

During play, the clerk (facilitator) is walking around taking notes (questions,
ideas, events) for future prep.  Anything non-physical that happens during the
session is non-mechanized, so to convince someone you must convince them.
Anything physical is a look-up by the facilitator, based on the [secret] stats
of those involved.  At the end of the session, players will tell the clerk what
they work on off-screen.

After the session, debrief with the group.  Talk about what happens in the week
to come, before the next meeting is called.  Come up with more problems and
opportunities, fill out the map some more, adjust beliefs as they're changed
through play, and tick clocks towards completion.

== Ludography
Standing on the shoulders of giants.  Not every inspiration is listed, of
course: some are totally unconscious.  Parallel development is also a thing.

== The basics
This is a story about the survivors of a fallen colony ship.  One of you plays
as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis[Gaia], with her eyes and ears
on the planet itself, its flora and fauna, and the colony.  The rest of you
play colonists, hoping to survive together.

=== The game
Exile isn't quite a "game" in the normal sense -- nobody's attempting to win,
and losing a character doesn't make you lose or anything.  It's more like a
structured way to play pretend.  We hand the reins of the experience over to
Gaia, and the other players build characters to control like they're piloting a
mech suit.

The nice thing about this is that we can avoid the old cops and robbers
argument of "I shot you!" "No, you didn't!" because someone's in charge of
deciding what happens at any given point.  It's not that much fun to always
just decide, though, so we'll often push it off to the dice.  The dice don't
feel as bad when things go poorly, so that's a bonus.  Stories where only good
things happen are seldom interesting.

Another nice thing about playing with a group of creative people is that nobody
has to come up with everything themselves.  Creativity is draining, especially
building a whole world up from nothing.  Sometimes you can make someone else
create, or use the rules and tables in this book (TODO) to prompt you.

==== No secrets
There are no secrets in Exile.  Either everyone at the table knows, or nobody
knows.  Hard and fast rule.

This means no character backstory that doesn't emerge from play.  It means no
building a world map on your own and then springing it on the other players.
It means don't write up the alien planet bird-watching book and consult it
when someone looks outside.

It also means you can't have secret plans that only you and Gaia know about,
springing them on the others only after completion.  Air those things out,
folks.

==== Scenes
Exile is played over a sequence of scenes, like a movie.  Between scenes is
a blank space for everyone to discuss plans, think through options, grab
snacks.  When there's an obvious next step, Gaia will open a scene to handle
that next step.

Gaia opens a scene by bringing a character or two in to play, and either says
what's going on or asks a player.  Keep scenes as focused as possible.  *When
somebody rolls dice, end the scene.*  Dice should resolve the core question of
the scene, so if the scene seems unfinished, it's probably not time to roll
dice yet.  Scenes can also end without dice (often just for color), if you
like.

Sometimes -- but not always -- one scene naturally leads into another.  Gaia
should feel free to cut from scene to scene immediately, without blank space.
Give everyone a chance to rest, though.  Continuous storytelling is exhausting.

Anyone can suggest a scene during the blank space, but Gaia's the final arbiter
of where the camera goes.  Be generous with screen time.

=== The colony
In a way, the colony is fortunate: this was the planet you set out to find, and
so it has breathable air, reasonable gravitational forces, and drinkable water.
You were never meant to return to Earth, so it's not like losing a viable
starship changes much.

There were several thousand people on the colony ship when it entered the
atmosphere.  At least a thousand survived the crash, at least initially.  After
that, it's up to you.  There's a ton of diversity in who's on board -- what
they know how to do, where they come from, what they look like, and so on.

This story is not about colony in-fighting, though that may happen.  Neither is
it about player-vs-player conflict.  No player's character is going to be an
antagonist here.  The planet is enough of one.  If an antagonist arises from
within the colony, Gaia will figure out what they do.  Players are on the same
team.

== Prelude
The first session starts with some world-building.  Nothing major, just enough
to get everyone on the same page and charge the situation so we start with
momentum.

_Exile_ has some defaults that you can adjust however you like, as long as you
maintain the crux of the situation: you lived in a broken world, left it to
make a new life in a different world, and can never go back.

=== What was the world like?
By default, the world you left was a near future version of the world you're
living in today.  Technology hand-waved to a point where we could build a
starship full of exiles, but otherwise very similar to now.  Anywhere is fine,
but you won't be able to get back there, and it isn't perfect.

=== Why did you leave?
By default, you left because of social and economic pressures: poverty and
discrimination and fear.  The group is large, you can have a bunch of reasons
that coexist.  It's not a pleasure cruise, though: you _had_ to leave.

=== What happened on the journey?
By default, the group split into various factions: describe them.  Perhaps you
ran into trouble on the way and lost a bunch of people to collision with space
debris.  Perhaps your flight path was incorrect and the trip was much longer
than expected.  It wasn't a short trip, but it's not the core of the game: just
a few bullet points are enough here.

=== Where did you go?
By default, you were heading to a planet that could sustain human life:
describe it.  Is it Earth-like, or just barely habitable?  Will you have to
live on the surface of an ocean, or is it mostly desert?

== Planetfall
Roll characters.  Everyone but Gaia is playing someone from the end of the
journey -- first generation exiles.

1. Name your colonist. (TODO: name lists!)
2. Roll four six-sided dice (4d6) and assign three of them to your three stats.
   - Mind: intelligence, planning, invention.
   - Body: strength, dexterity, constitution.
   - Spirit: charisma, morale, will.
3. The remaining die determines what you have with you at the start.
   - For each pip, describe (in a few words) something you carry off the ship.
   - Examples: a medical kit; a blaster rifle; a photo of my children.
4. Write down the reason you had to leave, using ideas from the prelude.

Once you have characters, collaboratively roll up the colony as well, in the
same way.

1. Name your colony. (TODO: name lists!)
2. Roll 4d6 and assign three of them to the colony's three stats.
   - Mind: plan out expansion, research flora and fauna characteristics.
   - Body: work the land, build and repair structures and tools.
   - Spirit: community morale, ability to work together.
3. The remaining die determines what's already built at the colony.
   - For each pip, describe (in a few words) something you've built.
   - Examples: fortifications, a laboratory, a community hall.
4. Write down a core piece of the colony's culture, a reaction to the prelude.

Grab a big piece of paper and write each colonist's name on it, with the colony
itself named in the center.  For every relationship that comes up in play, draw
a line between the entities involved and write the relationship down: this is
called an R-map ("relationship map"), and it's a great way to keep everyone on
the same page with respect to what's going on.  This will get messy -- let it.
You can always (and you probably should, if not every session, every few
sessions) re-draw it later.

Whenever someone (or something) new and important is mentioned, add it to the
map -- this means it needs a name!  Whenever people form a group of more than
two, add it to the map -- in most cases, you should also come up with a visual
signifier of membership in the group, and name it.  When people form a group of
two, connect them on the map.

If any colonist isn't connected at least two ways right out of the gate, go
around the table and answer some of these questions:

- What role do you feel you have in the colony right at the start?  Were you a
  primary founder?  Did you help build or plan?  Did you explore to find the
  site?  Draw a relationship between your colonist and the colony describing
  it.
- What other colonist do you feel is the most reliable?  The most intriguing?
  The most clever?  Draw a relationship between your colonist and that colonist
  describing what you think.

== Play
Most of play is just conversation.  People talk about what they do, and what
happens when they do it.  Don't worry about the minutia -- anything you
wouldn't see in the movies shouldn't be bothered with here.  In particular,
when players ask you for clarification: give it to them or turn the question
around.

The only time you roll the dice in Exile is when the scene comes to a head and
how it resolves is a major piece of tension.  That's when you turn to these
moves.  They're described in three parts.

- *The trigger:* When this is what the scene hinges on, get ready to roll!  In
   particular, if this isn't the core question of the scene, _don't roll._
   Rolling should always have serious, irreversible consequences.
- *The success:* "On a hit" means you rolled at least one 5 or 6.  This is
   what the roll is deciding at its core.  If you don't actually care about
   this, you probably don't want to trigger the move.  Step back and
   re-evaluate.  On a miss, of course, you don't get this, and you'll have
   some serious problems to deal with.
- *The options:* Help everyone else understand what's at stake here before you
   roll, so you're all on the same page.  Perhaps you don't care how long it
   takes, but you've got to be rested when you get there.  This is what the
   options are for.  You can choose a few, but if you don't roll as many hits
   as options picked, Gaia gets to decide which one applies.  (Even one hit
   means you do the thing, though, so you're still safe there.)

When you resolve a scene, do so in this order:

1. *Intent.*  What's the plot here?  Pick a relevant move.
2. *Choice.*  Each move comes with a few options, pick as many as you like (but
   always at least one).  The number of options you pick determines the
   difficulty number: how many hits you need.
3. *Cost.*  For the options you don't pick, Gaia will describe
   immediate costs.  You can still back out and pick those options at this
   point, and they won't (necessary) happen!  Once you roll the dice, though,
   these costs are locked in.  Gaia: be nice.  Sometimes, these shouldn't
   matter.  Sometimes they obviously do.
4. *The Roll.*  Build your pool and roll the dice.  All the costs apply
   immediately after, no matter what you roll.  Look for hits (5s and 6s) and
   count 'em up.
5. *Consequences.*  If you rolled enough hits to cover your choices,
   congratulations!  You got everything you wanted.  If you rolled at least one
   hit, but not enough to cover your choices, Gaia will make a move.  The more
   you missed by, the stronger that move can be.  If you didn't roll even one
   hit, the scene is tragic.

=== Basic Moves

TODO

image::img/harvest.png[]
== Gaia
This is your planet, Gaia.  These are your rules.  If you've played other
things like this, note that these are _rules_, not just gamemaster suggestions.
Treat them as such.

=== Agenda
The other players only need to say what their characters do, and play them like
people.  That's much easier than your role.  Everything you say needs to work
towards these:

- Show both strange and familiar from the planet.
- Show the humanity of the colony.
- Play to find out what happens when they meet.

You're not trying to kill the characters (though they will certainly die --
give them a good death), you're not trying to show them your sci-fi collection,
and you're certainly not trying to take over the colony with your own people.

Play to find out: You have to commit to the unknown. Don't worry about what's
behind the next corner or what's over that mountain. _Exile_ and other things
like it are powerful because the world is just a shared imaginary space. If you
say something's there, it's there. If they go around the corner, that's when
you can think about what's there. If they climb the mountain, that's when you
can figure out what they can see.

When you're figuring that stuff out, you've got two responsibilities: make the
planet strange yet familiar, and show that the colonists are still human. If
you can't figure out how to do this in the moment, ask the other players!
They're on your team, here to help. Coming up with stuff on the fly is hard.
I'll do what I can to give you prompts. Of course, if you have just the most
amazing idea come to you right as they round that corner, don't let the prompts
stand in your way.

=== Your moves
Yes, you have these too. They're a bit different, though: Gaia doesn't roll
dice. Instead, you should be thinking about that fiction and figuring out what
that next shot would be. When there's a pause in a scene, or people don't know
what the next scene should be, or someone fails a roll, or doesn't get enough
hits, you get to do one of these things.

- Change the environment
- Introduce new flora or fauna
- Put a threat on the horizon
- Show a downside
- Add a cost
- Reverse their move
- Break their stuff
- Hurt them

==== Change the environment
Weather patterns. Landscape features. Astronomical phenomenon. This is not
Earth you're living on.

> The rain falls thick, like each drop was poured from a bucket. Not going to
> be comfortable going anywhere in that storm.

> Today, all three of the local stars are in the sky. It's going to be a hot
> one.

> Looks like this river is made of molasses, but the smell proves that false.
> How do you get across?

==== Introduce new flora or fauna
One of the best ways to make the planet strange is to make the stuff living
there a bit off, too. Start with something familiar and twist it.

> A low growl makes you look up, and you see a flock of ... dogs?

> Up in those vines are wrapped all sorts of animals, each in various stages of
> rot. You see one wriggle a bit, then the vine quickly constricts it further.

> It's a herd of something, like horses but -- Amanda, what seems odd about
> these animals to you?

==== Put a threat on the horizon
This is a nice soft move for when things get a bit too simple.

> You see smoke -- or is it dust? -- off in the distance, and hear a rumble
> growing louder through the ground.

> Each day, another colonist comes back from foraging the ship with radiation
> burns. They're starting to avoid salvage duty.

> There's less of a herd today from yesterday. Some of the scouts say they've
> seen their herds leave completely.

==== Show a downside
Especially when someone thinks they've found a way to cheat the system, look
for something in the fiction that just doesn't seem right, and push it.
Something can always go wrong.

> Your plasma rifle just isn't very useful at this range -- by the time you
> charge up a shot, it'll have closed to claw distance.

> Sure, the lab can make an antidote, but it'll take about a week.

> You're really feeling the need for more of those meds now that you've been
> taking them for a while. The normal dose just isn't cutting it.

==== Add a cost
This could be literal -- perhaps the colonists have set up a barter system, or
even some currency. More often it's figurative, though.

> You bring one of those flying dogs down, but you got some bites on the way.
> Hope they're not infected with anything dangerous.

> Swimming across that river could sweep you way downstream, is that alright?

> Your orders were necessary, but very hard to give. How do you keep yourself
> from getting too down about it?

==== Reverse their move
Pick one of the options and flip it around -- tend towards one they didn't
choose, when you're feeling kind.

> You find the radio, but the knob got smashed; it's stuck on the command
> channel at the moment.

> You get to the crystal spire, but the way there was steep and you're
> exhausted.

> Arlea will do what you asked, but she's not happy about it.

==== Break their stuff
Generally, stuff will break in lieu of the characters becoming broken, so
they've got that going for 'em.

> You take down the beast, but your spear is unrecoverable.

> The drugs are wearing off, and you feel the world becoming darker.

> Your handheld smashes on the rocks, and I don't think that screen's turning
> back on.

==== Hurt them
Pick a stat and explain why it drops, fictionally. Stat loss is permanent in
Exile (though characters can prop themselves up with technology), so don't do
this lightly.  Do it, though: especially on a miss, or in those times when they
invite clear and present danger right in.

> An explosion very close by sets your ears to ringing; your left one will
> probably never recover. Take -1 to senses.

> You hit the ground hard and break your leg. Take -1 to body and good luck
> running from the flying dogs.

> You find your old friend on the ship, but they've gone cold. Take -1 to
> spirit.

== The basics
This is a story about the survivors of a fallen colony ship.  One of you plays
as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis[Gaia], with her eyes and ears
on the planet itself, its flora and fauna, and the colony.  The rest of you
play colonists, hoping to survive together.

=== The game
Exile isn't quite a "game" in the normal sense -- nobody's attempting to win,
and losing a character doesn't make you lose or anything.  It's more like a
structured way to play pretend.  We hand the reins of the experience over to
Gaia, and the other players build characters to control like they're piloting a
mech suit.

The nice thing about this is that we can avoid the old cops and robbers
argument of "I shot you!" "No, you didn't!" because someone's in charge of
deciding what happens at any given point.  It's not that much fun to always
just decide, though, so we'll often push it off to the dice.  The dice don't
feel as bad when things go poorly, so that's a bonus.  Stories where only good
things happen are seldom interesting.

Another nice thing about playing with a group of creative people is that nobody
has to come up with everything themselves.  Creativity is draining, especially
building a whole world up from nothing.  Sometimes you can make someone else
create, or use the rules and tables in this book (TODO) to prompt you.

==== No secrets
There are no secrets in Exile.  Either everyone at the table knows, or nobody
knows.  Hard and fast rule.

This means no character backstory that doesn't emerge from play.  It means no
building a world map on your own and then springing it on the other players.
It means don't write up the alien planet bird-watching book and consult it
when someone looks outside.

It also means you can't have secret plans that only you and Gaia know about,
springing them on the others only after completion.  Air those things out,
folks.

==== Scenes
Exile is played over a sequence of scenes, like a movie.  Between scenes is
a blank space for everyone to discuss plans, think through options, grab
snacks.  When there's an obvious next step, Gaia will open a scene to handle
that next step.

Keep scenes as focused as possible, and end them when they go unfocused.

Gaia opens a scene by bringing a character or two in to play, and either says
what's going on or asks a player.  When the core of that scene is resolved, or
it goes unfocused, Gaia will close it out.

Sometimes -- but not always -- one scene naturally leads into another.  Gaia
should feel free to cut from scene to scene immediately, without blank space.
Give everyone a chance to rest, though.  Continuous storytelling is exhausting.

Anyone can suggest a scene during the blank space, but Gaia's the final arbiter
of where the camera goes.  Be generous with screen time.

=== The colony
In a way, the colony is fortunate: this was the planet you set out to find, and
so it has breathable air, reasonable gravitational forces, and drinkable water.
You were never meant to return to Earth, so it's not like losing a viable
starship changes much.

There were several thousand people on the colony ship when it entered the
atmosphere.  At least a thousand survived the crash, at least initially.  After
that, it's up to you.  There's a ton of diversity in who's on board -- what
they know how to do, where they come from, what they look like, and so on.

This story is not about colony in-fighting, though that may happen.  Neither is
it about player-vs-player conflict.  No player's character is going to be an
antagonist here.  The planet is enough of one.  If an antagonist arises from
within the colony, Gaia will figure out what they do.  Players are on the same
team.

== Colonists
To create a colonist, pick a playbook and roll four six-sided dice (4d6).
Assign these dice to the four colonist attributes (higher is better):

- Mind: intelligence, wisdom, ability to learn.
- Body: strength, dexterity, constitution.
- Spirit: charisma, morale, emotional intelligence.
- Sense: sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste.

Choose one of the roles, think about your look, and be ready to play out your
planetfall scene.

=== Playbooks

==== The Artificium, a faction of newly-sentient robots.
Before the fall, robots assisted in (or performed) all colony ship duties.  As
the trip wore on, their neural networks started to develop what some in the
Society would term _consciousness_.

[horizontal]
Roles:: a philosopher, a guard, a cleaner.
Look:: How can a colonist tell if someone's a robot?
Scene:: In the pitch-blackness of the ship, what do you hear?

==== The Corps, accidental colonists.
You never asked for this.  It was supposed to be a one-term job, nicely
lucrative, and then retirement at home, where you belong.  No such luck, I
guess.  Better hole up and hope another wave comes to investigate.

[horizontal]
Roles:: an officer, a veteran, a greenie.
Look:: What weapon is every member trained in?
Scene:: Fade in to a room with no survivors, what do you see?

==== The Guild, merchants tied together by wealth and shared interests.
Tied together by wealth, a Guild is fickle.  Produce, and you're on top of the
world.  Just make sure your well doesn't dry up.

[horizontal]
Roles:: a boss, an accountant, an enforcer.
Look:: What's the resource you control, and how does that feature on your
       sigil?
Scene:: Zoom out from a conference table, what are you arguing about?

==== The Hermit, a solitary soul who needs the colony to survive.
You came to escape.  Just you, by yourself.  Good luck.

[horizontal]
Roles:: monastic, artistic, solitary.
Look:: What do the colonists notice first about you, and use to label you?
       (None of them knows your real name.)
Scene:: Cut to yelling over a roaring fire, what do you do?

==== The House, an aristocracy tied together by bloodline.
Tied together by bloodline, it's difficult to be accepted in a House that you
aren't born into.  After planetfall, the house might just need all the help it
can get.

[horizontal]
Roles:: a matriarch or patriarch, an heir, a trusted friend.
Look:: What physical features do all the people of your house share?
Scene:: Pan up from the floor, covered in rubble. What heirloom do you find?

==== The Religion, a congregation tied together by a shared belief.
Tied together by belief, a Religion offers hope for the hopeless.
Unfortunately, how do you know what's solid ground on in a strange planet?

[horizontal]
Roles:: a priest, an acolyte, a layman.
Look:: What symbol do you wear to show your affiliation?
Scene:: Fade in to the first light from the planet, what color is it?

==== The Society, tied together by curiosity and a desire for knowledge.
Tied together by curiosity, which is the loosest bond of all.  Sometimes it
pays off.  Sometimes you breathe ether.

[horizontal]
Roles:: a scientist, an engineer, an explorer.
Look:: What type of clothing shows your membership of the society?
Scene:: The planet's air blows through a gash in the hull, what do you smell?

== Planetfall
Get out a piece of blank white paper and draw a bullseye on it.  In the center
is your crash site.

Each player in turn should decide what their character was before planetfall by
picking a playbook and a role, and then play out the associated scene.

Play the scene for a minute or two, enough to show the character, the broken
ship, the planet, and then cut.  You don't need to show every second of life in
the aftermath of planetfall, this is more of a montage.  After each scene,
players should consider their immediate priorities and write one down as a
goal.

When the introductory scenes are done, everyone should have answered for their
playbook's look, and come up with their character's goal.  In the blank space
after the last introductory scene, decide where to fade in.

== Play
Most of play is just conversation.  People talk about what they do, and what
happens when they do it.  Don't worry about the minutia -- anything you
wouldn't see in the movies shouldn't be bothered with here.  Batman doesn't
ride the bus to the crime scene, he just shows up.

Sometimes, a character will do something, and you can just hear the soundtrack
picking up.  Generally, that means it's time to roll the dice.  I've got a
few of these times listed below.  In Powered by the Apocalypse games, these are
called *moves.*  Read them in three parts:

1. *The trigger:* When this happens in the fiction, get ready to roll!  In
   particular, if this _doesn't_ happen, _don't roll._
2. *The success:* "On a hit" means you rolled at least one 5 or 6.  This is
   what the roll is deciding at its core.  If you don't actually care about
   this, you probably don't want to trigger the move.  Step back and
   re-evaluate.  On a miss, of course, you don't get this, and you'll have
   some serious problems to deal with: failure is irrevocable in Exile.
3. *The options:* Help everyone else understand what's at stake here before you
   roll, so you're all on the same page.  Perhaps you don't care how long it
   takes, but you've got to be rested when you get there.  This is what the
   options are for.  You can choose a few, but if you don't roll as many hits
   as options picked, Gaia gets to decide which ones apply.  (Even one hit
   means you do the thing, though, so you're still safe there.)

=== Basic Moves

When you *remember where something important was on the ship,* name it and
choose at least one, then roll mind.  On a hit, you know where it is.

[options="compact"]
- it's close to you
- you know a secret way
- you have the access codes

When you *make your way to an interesting place,* find (or draw) it on the map
and choose at least one, then roll body.  On a hit, you get there.  If it isn’t
named, name it.

[options="compact"]
- it doesn’t take much time
- nobody / nothing notices you
- you’re not worn out by the trip

When you *give orders to the colonists,* say what they are and choose at least
one, then roll spirit.  On a hit, they do what you say.

[options="compact"]
- they jump to it
- they’re experienced at this kind of thing
- nobody takes offense

When you *look for something useful nearby,* name it and choose at least one,
then roll senses.  On a hit, you find it.

[options="compact"]
- it’s in perfect repair
- it’s hard to break
- nobody else wants it right now

== Gaia
This is your planet, Gaia.  These are your rules.  If you've played other
things like this, note that these are _rules_, not just gamemaster suggestions.
Treat them as such.

=== Agenda
The other players only need to say what their characters do, and play them like
people.  That's much easier than your role.  Everything you say needs to work
towards these:

- Show both strange and familiar from the planet.
- Show the humanity of the colony.
- Play to find out what happens when they meet.

You're not trying to kill the characters (though they will certainly die --
give them a good death), you're not trying to show them your sci-fi collection,
and you're certainly not trying to take over the colony with your own people.

Play to find out: You have to commit to the unknown. Don't worry about what's
behind the next corner or what's over that mountain. Exile and other games like
it are powerful because the world is just a shared imaginary space. If you say
something's there, it's there. When they go around the corner, then you can
think about what's there. When they climb the mountain, then you can figure out
what they can see.

When you're figuring that stuff out, you've got two responsibilities: make the
planet strange yet familiar, and show that the colonists are still human. If
you can't figure out how to do this in the moment, ask the other players!
They're on your team, here to help. Coming up with stuff on the fly is hard.
I'll do what I can to give you prompts. Of course, if you have just the most
amazing idea come to you right as they round that corner, don't let the prompts
stand in your way.

=== Your moves
Yes, you have these too. They're a bit different, though: Gaia doesn't roll
dice. Instead, you should be thinking about that fiction and figuring out what
that next shot would be. When there's a pause in a scene, or people don't know
what the next scene should be, or someone fails a roll, or doesn't get enough
hits, you get to do one of these things.

- Change the environment
- Introduce new flora or fauna
- Put a threat on the horizon
- Show a downside
- Add a cost
- Reverse their move
- Break their stuff
- Hurt them

==== Change the environment
Weather patterns. Landscape features. Astronomical phenomenon. This is not
Earth you're living on.

> The rain falls thick, like each drop was poured from a bucket. Not going to
> be comfortable going anywhere in that storm.

> Today, all three of the local stars are in the sky. It's going to be a hot
> one.

> Looks like this river is made of molasses, but the smell proves that false.
> How do you get across? 

==== Introduce new flora or fauna
One of the best ways to make the planet strange is to make the stuff living
there a bit off, too. Start with something familiar and twist it.

> A low growl makes you look up, and you see a flock of ... dogs?

> Up in those vines are wrapped all sorts of animals, each in various stages of
> rot. You see one wriggle a bit, then the vine quickly constricts it further.

> It's a herd of something, like horses but -- Amanda, what seems odd about
> these animals to you?

==== Put a threat on the horizon
This is a nice soft move for when things get a bit too simple.

> You see smoke -- or is it dust? -- off in the distance, and hear a rumble
> growing louder through the ground.

> Each day, another colonist comes back from foraging the ship with radiation
> burns. They're starting to avoid salvage duty.

> There's less of a herd today from yesterday. Some of the scouts say they've
> seen their herds leave completely.

==== Show a downside
Especially when someone thinks they've found a way to cheat the system, look
for something in the fiction that just doesn't seem right, and push it.
Something can always go wrong.

> Your plasma rifle just isn't very useful at this range -- by the time you
> charge up a shot, it'll have closed to claw distance.

> Sure, the lab can make an antidote, but it'll take about a week.

> You're really feeling the need for more of those meds now that you've been
> taking them for a while. The normal dose just isn't cutting it.

==== Add a cost
This could be literal -- perhaps the colonists have set up a barter system, or
even some currency. More often it's figurative, though.

> You bring one of those flying dogs down, but you got some bites on the way.
> Hope they're not infected with anything dangerous.

> Swimming across that river could sweep you way downstream, is that alright?

> Your orders were necessary, but very hard to give. How do you keep yourself
> from getting too down about it?

==== Reverse their move
Pick one of the options and flip it around -- tend towards one they didn't
choose, when you're feeling kind.

> You find the radio, but the knob got smashed; it's stuck on the command
> channel at the moment.

> You get to the crystal spire, but the way there was steep and you're
> exhausted.

> Arlea will do what you asked, but she's not happy about it.

==== Break their stuff
Generally, stuff will break in lieu of the characters becoming broken, so
they've got that going for 'em.

> You take down the beast, but your spear is unrecoverable.

> The drugs are wearing off, and you feel the world becoming darker.

> Your handheld smashes on the rocks, and I don't think that screen's turning
> back on.

==== Hurt them
Pick a stat and explain why it drops, fictionally. Stat loss is permanent in
Exile (though characters can prop themselves up with technology), so don't do
this lightly.  Do it, though: especially on a miss, or in those times when they
invite clear and present danger right in.

> An explosion very close by sets your ears to ringing; your left one will
> probably never recover. Take -1 to senses.

> You hit the ground hard and break your leg. Take -1 to body and good luck
> running from the flying dogs.

> You find your old friend on the ship, but they've gone cold. Take -1 to
> spirit.

course: some are totally unconscious.  Parallel development is also a thing.

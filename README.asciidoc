- What is your game about? (Premise)
  - _Making tools as a fundamental piece of humanity._
- How does it go about that? (Elements)
  - Technology determines the range of success values on dice.
  - Art enables players to recover from tax on their will.
  - Conflicts around _making_ are serious business. (DW Wizard's Ritual)
- What does it reward? (System)

== The basics
image:planetfall-bw.png[]
(core mechanisms)

Actions are rated by die size, from d4 to d12.
Tools are numerically rated, from 0 to 4.
Roll like Blades in the Dark (highest), but using Ob effectively doubled from
Burning Wheel:

- Ob 2 is Easy
- Ob 4 is Routine
- Ob 6 is Difficult
- Ob 8 is Extremely Difficult
- Ob 10 is Master-level
- Ob 12 is Heroic Effort
- Ob 14 is Ludicrously Difficult
- Ob 16 is Nearly Impossible
- Ob 18 is Phenomenally Difficult
- Ob 20 is Miraculous

When these rolls succeed, the player gets what they want. (Intent & Task)
When they fail:
- Tax them with conditions. Health, Will, Tool.
  - Broken tools grant half dice, rounded down.
- Twist them. Think offscreen too, fail-forward.

FoRK / help / advantages grant dice.

Advancement as in Mouse Guard: Success / Failure marked on the action. Need a
number of successes equal to the die size and Failures equal to one less to
advance.

Experience with tools helps, as well, increasing the number of dice you roll.

== Planetfall

(first time character generation)

Ten thousand colonists left Earth for this class-M planet. Probes have been
here in orbit for decades mapping the surface, just like every other colony.
The colony ship dropped in to orbit the planet safely while supplies and people
were dropped off, but something happened to it and now you’re here a little
early.

Your ship lies in a heap of wreckage, strewn about the planet, and you have to
build up a colony without many of the safeguards sent with you. You also have
the crew of the colony ship, who never wanted to stay.

=== Choose a heritage
Your character's *heritage* describes where they're from. When you choose a
heritage, write a detail about your family life on the line above.

=== Choose a background
Your character's *background* describes what they did before they left Earth.
Choose a background and then write a detail about it that’s specific to your
character.

=== Advance four action dice
Advance your four dice (d4 to d6, d6 to d8) like this:

- Advance one action that you feel reflects your character's heritage.
- Advance one action that you feel reflects your character's background.
- Advance two more actions anywhere you please (max rating is 2, remember).

(conflicts with the planet itself)

== Colony phase
(spend checks to do stuff, including condition relief mini-scenes)

== Actions
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_technology)

Skills are grouped metaphorically. Two people trying to hurt each other is a
Fight, while leading hundreds or thousands in war is more like a Craft. Groups
have specifics to them -- Fight with a Bow is different from Fight with a
Spear. Gathering information about your prey in a hunting conflict is different
from Gathering sticks off the ground.

=== Insight
- When you *Hunt*, you carefully track a target.
- When you *Gather*, you collect things or ideas from the world around you.
- When you *Play*, you explore the edges of a space, like a game or instrument or idea.
- When you *Refine*, you turn one substance into another more useful or beautiful.

=== Prowess
- When you *Fight*, you blatantly hurt something or someone.
- When you *Traverse*, you make your way across a dangerous place.
- When you *Manipulate*, you carefully and subtly change something's state or position.
- When you *Trap*, you capture something, like a person in an argument or an animal in a snare.

=== Resolve
- When you *Craft*, you make something useful or beautiful.
- When you *Cultivate*, you help something grow and change into something else.
- When you *Share*, you transfer concepts, stories, or understanding to other people.
- When you *Restore*, you take something damaged and return it to a pristine state.

== Gaia
(GM playbooks / adventure starters for various biomes)
(Can Gaia have beliefs / instincts / traits? == Agenda & Principles)

=== Portray a living planet.
Everything on the planet wants to survive and procreate. If a niche appears,
life will fill it. 

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_animals
  Show the "commensal" pathway with animals / plants feeding on the edges of
  the colony (either on the colony's waste directly or on what it draws near).
- Seasons with weather conflicts, probably worth including in the starters.

=== Apply the continuous pressure of entropy.
Things break, wear down, rust, die.

=== Play to learn about humanity from an outsider's perspective.

=== The Wine Dark Sea
(an ocean filled with life, with the colony floating atop it)

=== City of Brass
(ancient ruins of an alien city)

=== Green Light
(a forest canopy, miles above the surface)

== The shipwreck

== Descendants
(later character generation)

== Giants

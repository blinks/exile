= The basics

This is a story about the survivors of a fallen colony ship.  One of you plays
as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis[Gaia], with her eyes and ears
on the planet itself, its flora and fauna, and the colony.  The rest of you
play colonists, hoping to survive.

In a way, the colony is fortunate: this was the planet you set out to find, and
so it has breathable air, reasonable gravitational forces, and drinkable water.
You were never meant to return to Earth, so it's not like losing a viable
starship changes much.

= Colonists

To create a colonist, name them and roll four six-sided dice (4d6).  Assign
these dice to the four colonist attributes:

- Mind: intelligence, wisdom, ability to learn, etc.
- Body: strength, dexterity, constitution, etc.
- Spirit: charisma, morale, emotional intelligence, etc.
- Sense: sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste, etc.

In play, you'll be forming pools of dice based on these attributes and rolling
them, looking for 5s and 6s: hits.  The more hits, the better.

course: some are totally unconscious.  Parallel development is also a thing.

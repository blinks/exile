== The basics


=== Prep
- create / update map (bullseye divided into segments, ship at center)
- create / update characters as needed (draw for stats, which are secret)
- draw (or decide) the situation.

=== Session
. Dawn. (Free play, wandering time, clerk seeds everyone with recent issues
  and opportunities.)
. Day. (If anyone wants to call for scenes, they can do so.)
. Dusk. (The meeting. Where is it? Who calls it to order?  Who’s supposed to
  be there?  Who’s there anyway?  What do they decide?)

During play, the clerk (facilitator) is walking around taking notes (questions,
ideas, events) for future prep.  Anything non-physical that happens during the
session is non-mechanized, so to convince someone you must convince them.
Anything physical is a look-up by the facilitator, based on the [secret] stats
of those involved.  At the end of the session, players will tell the clerk what
they work on off-screen.

== Characters
The Captain:: Secretly intended to crash the ship, Cortez-style, but didn’t
mean to strand the corps here. Wants to impose military order with himself at
the head.

The Merchant:: An ambassador of sorts from the Guild, to set up interstellar
trade routes; current situation means they better start smaller, but it’d be
nice to ship off-planet.

The Prince:: Third son, forced into exile to save his family some embarrassment
-— but here, he’s certainly the senior heir.

The Priestess:: Planetfall gave her a brief moment of enlightenment, and she
thinks Gaia is calling her to start a new religion.  She might be right.

The Scientist:: A whole new world to explore and learn about, and a small pond
for them to be a big fish in.

The Veteran:: Stranded here on accident, she thinks the ship can be repaired
enough to get at least some people back into the black.

== Ludography
Standing on the shoulders of giants.  Not every inspiration is listed, of
course: some are totally unconscious.  Parallel development is also a thing.

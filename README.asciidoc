= The basics
This is a story about the survivors of a fallen colony ship.  One of you plays
as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis[Gaia], with her eyes and ears
on the planet itself, its flora and fauna, and the colony.  The rest of you
play colonists, hoping to survive.

In a way, the colony is fortunate: this was the planet you set out to find, and
so it has breathable air, reasonable gravitational forces, and drinkable water.
You were never meant to return to Earth, so it's not like losing a viable
starship changes much.

== Scenes
Exile is played over a sequence of scenes, like a movie.  Between scenes is
time for players to discuss plans, think through options, grab snacks.  When
there's an obvious next step, Gaia will open a scene -- describing the weather,
the sights, sounds, smells, and bring a character or two in to play.  When the
core of that scene is resolved, Gaia will close it out.

Sometimes -- but not always -- one scene naturally leads into another.  Gaia
should feel free to cut from scene to scene immediately, without blank space.
Give everyone a chance to rest, though.  Continuous storytelling is exhausting.

= Colonists
To create a colonist, name them and roll four six-sided dice (4d6).  Assign
these dice to the four colonist attributes:

- Mind: intelligence, wisdom, ability to learn, etc.
- Body: strength, dexterity, constitution, etc.
- Spirit: charisma, morale, emotional intelligence, etc.
- Sense: sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste, etc.

In play, you'll be forming pools of dice based on these attributes and rolling
them, looking for 5s and 6s: hits.  The more hits, the better.  With no hits,
your life is in Gaia's hands.

= Planetfall
For each character, pick a prelude scene:

- You awaken in the pitch-blackness of the ship.
- You see your first light from the planet.
- You find a room with no survivors.
- You hear yelling over a roaring fire.
- You smell the burning sulfur of broken engines.
- You feel the planet's air coming through a gash in the hull.

Play the scene for a minute or two, enough to show the character, and then cut.
You don't need to show every second of life in the aftermath of planetfall,
this is more of a montage.  When all characters have been introduced, ask what
the immediate priorities are, and write them down.  Then, start a new scene.

Standing on the shoulders of giants.  Not every inspiration is listed, of
course: some are totally unconscious.  Parallel development is also a thing.

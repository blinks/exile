- What is your game about? (Premise)
  - _Making stuff as a fundamental piece of humanity._
- How does it go about that? (Elements)
  - Technology determines the range of success values on dice.
  - Art enables players to recover from tax on their will.
  - Conflicts around _making_ are serious business. (DW Wizard's Ritual)
- What does it reward? (System)
  - 

== The basics

(core mechanisms)

d6 pool, 4+ with basic tools or less, 3+ with great tools, 2+ with the best
tools. (If you have poor eyesight, perhaps 5+ for perception without basic
tools.)

When these rolls succeed, the player gets what they want. (Intent & Task)
When they fail:
- Tax them. Health, Will, Technology.
- Twist them. Think offscreen too, fail-forward.

FoRK / help / advantages grant dice.

Advancement as in Mouse Guard.

=== Attributes

(will, health)
Injury is a tax on health. Stress is a tax on will. Technology can help with
the former, art can help the latter. If either is taxed to zero, the character
is not long for this world.

(clout, resources)

(nature)

== Planetfall

(first time character generation)

Ten thousand colonists left Earth for this class-M planet. Probes have been
here in orbit for decades mapping the surface, just like every other colony.
The colony ship dropped in to orbit the planet safely while supplies and people
were dropped off, but something happened to it and now youâ€™re here a little
early.

Your ship lies in a heap of wreckage, strewn about the planet, and you have to
build up a colony without many of the safeguards sent with you. You also have
the crew of the colony ship, who never wanted to stay.

== Wilderness phase

(conflicts with the planet itself)

== Colony phase
(spend checks to do stuff, including tax relief mini-scenes)

Wiser -> gain a wise related to something you worked with?
Performance -> test to relieve a bunch of will tax. (Your own / others.)
  - like a resources check.

=== Medicine
To recover from a tax on health, you'll need technology to help you recover.

=== Art
To recover from a tax on will, you'll need art to help you recover.

== Skills
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_technology)

- Various Weapons (bow? spear? etc.)
- Various Instruments (lute? singing? etc.)
- Various Art Media (paints? charcoal? etc.)
- Various Crafting (stone-crafting, wood-crafting, etc.)
- Various Food (agriculture, butchery, foraging, hunting, trapping, etc.)
- Taming, but not Domestication (which is genetic modification over time)

== Gaia
(GM playbooks / adventure starters for various biomes)
(Can Gaia have beliefs / instincts / traits? == Agenda & Principles)

=== Portray a living planet.
Everything on the planet wants to survive and procreate. If a niche appears,
life will fill it. 

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_animals
  Show the "commensal" pathway with animals / plants feeding on the edges of
  the colony (either on the colony's waste directly or on what it draws near).
- Seasons with weather conflicts, probably worth including in the starters.

=== Apply the continuous pressure of entropy.
Things break, wear down, rust, die.

=== Play to learn about humanity from an outsider's perspective.

=== The Wine Dark Sea
(an ocean filled with life, with the colony floating atop it)

=== City of Brass
(ancient ruins of an alien city)

=== Green Light
(a forest canopy, miles above the surface)

== The shipwreck

== Descendants
(later character generation)

== Giants

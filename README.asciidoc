= The basics
This is a story about the survivors of a fallen colony ship.  One of you plays
as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis[Gaia], with her eyes and ears
on the planet itself, its flora and fauna, and the colony.  The rest of you
play colonists, hoping to survive.

In a way, the colony is fortunate: this was the planet you set out to find, and
so it has breathable air, reasonable gravitational forces, and drinkable water.
You were never meant to return to Earth, so it's not like losing a viable
starship changes much.

== Scenes
Exile is played over a sequence of scenes, like a movie.  Between scenes is
a blank space for everyone to discuss plans, think through options, grab
snacks.  When there's an obvious next step, Gaia will open a scene to handle
that next step.

Keep scenes as focused as possible, and end them when they go unfocused.

Gaia opens a scene by bringing a character or two in to play, and either says
what's going on or asks a player.  When the core of that scene is resolved, or
it goes unfocused, Gaia will close it out.

Sometimes -- but not always -- one scene naturally leads into another.  Gaia
should feel free to cut from scene to scene immediately, without blank space.
Give everyone a chance to rest, though.  Continuous storytelling is exhausting.

= Colonists
To create a colonist, pick a playbook and roll four six-sided dice (4d6).
Assign these dice to the four colonist attributes:

- Mind: intelligence, wisdom, ability to learn, etc.
- Body: strength, dexterity, constitution, etc.
- Spirit: charisma, morale, emotional intelligence, etc.
- Sense: sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste, etc.

In play, you'll be forming pools of dice based on these attributes and rolling
them, looking for 5s and 6s: hits.  The more hits, the better.  With no hits,
your life is in Gaia's hands.  Rolling in Exile only happens for big things,
too -- instead of rolling ten times for a fight scene, you should only be
rolling once or (at most) twice.

Choose one of the roles, and be ready to play out your planetfall scene.

== Playbooks

=== The Artificium, a faction of newly-sentient robots.
Before the fall, robots assisted in (or performed) all colony ship duties.  As
the trip wore on, their neural networks started to develop what some in the
Society would term _consciousness_.

Roles:: a philosopher, a guard, a cleaner.
Look:: How can a colonist tell if someone's a robot?
Scene:: In the pitch-blackness of the ship, what do you hear?

=== The Corps, accidental colonists.
You never asked for this.  It was supposed to be a one-term job, nicely
lucrative, and then retirement at home, where you belong.  No such luck, I
guess.  Better hole up and hope another wave comes to investigate.

Roles:: an officer, a veteran, a greenie.
Look:: What weapon is every member trained in?
Scene:: Fade in to a room with no survivors, what do you see?

=== The Guild, merchants tied together by wealth and shared interests.
Tied together by wealth, a Guild is fickle.  Produce, and you're on top of the
world.  Just make sure your well doesn't dry up.

Roles:: a boss, an accountant, an enforcer.
Look:: What's the resource you control, and how does that feature on your
       sigil?
Scene:: Zoom out from a conference table, what are you arguing about?

=== The Hermit, a solitary soul who needs the colony to survive.
You came to escape.  Just you, by yourself.  Good luck.

Roles:: monastic, artistic, solitary.
Look:: What do the colonists notice first about you, and use to label you?
       (None of them knows your real name.)
Scene:: Cut to yelling over a roaring fire, what do you do?

=== The House, an aristocracy tied together by bloodline.
Tied together by bloodline, it's difficult to be accepted in a House that you
aren't born into.  After planetfall, the house might just need all the help it
can get.

Roles:: a matriarch or patriarch, an heir, a trusted friend.
Look:: What physical features do all the people of your house share?
Scene:: Pan up from the floor, covered in rubble. What heirloom do you find? 

=== The Religion, a congregation tied together by a shared belief.
Tied together by belief, a Religion offers hope for the hopeless.
Unfortunately, how do you know what's solid ground on in a strange planet?

Roles:: a priest, an acolyte, a layman.
Look:: What symbol do you wear to show your affiliation?
Scene:: Fade in to the first light from the planet, what color is it?

=== The Society, tied together by curiosity and a desire for knowledge.
Tied together by curiosity, which is the loosest bond of all.  Sometimes it
pays off.  Sometimes you breathe ether.

Roles:: a scientist, an engineer, an explorer.
Look:: What type of clothing shows your membership of the society?
Scene:: The planet's air blows through a gash in the hull, what do you smell?

= Planetfall
Each player in turn should decide what their character was before planetfall by
picking a playbook and a role, and then play out the associated scene.

Play the scene for a minute or two, enough to show the character, the broken
ship, the planet, and then cut.  You don't need to show every second of life in
the aftermath of planetfall, this is more of a montage.  After each scene,
players should consider their immediate priorities and write one down as a
goal.

When the introductory scenes are done, everyone should have answered for their
playbook's look, and come up with their character's goal.  In the blank space
after the last introductory scene, decide where to fade in.

course: some are totally unconscious.  Parallel development is also a thing.

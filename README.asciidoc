A parlor larp about the people on a crashed colony ship, in four acts.

You’ll need three to eight-ish players, one of which will play Gaia (the
facilitator). Additional people can spectate. You’ll also need a deck of
Lenormand cards, which you can make from a normal deck of playing cards by
removing the 2s through 6s and labeling the rest. (See the appendix.)

TODO: Safety & trust protocol.

== Act 0: Gaia
Gaia playbooks for the Exile facilitator!

- The Wine Dark Sea (Subnautica)
- City of Brass (ancient alien ruins)
- Green Light (mile-high forest canopy)

These would be half dungeon starter, half playbook, and push Gaia to build out
the food chain and habitats in a kind of R-map.

Moves? Threats: Adaptation, disasters, migration, weather patterns.

Choose it before planetfall, so they know whether to take that diving gear.

== Act I: Planetfall

TODO: Gaia playbooks.

Deal three cards to each player to randomly assign them a character. Players
can each discard any of their cards to draw new ones, especially if a card’s
meaning is something they feel uncomfortable with, or is something they’d
rather not play. To create your character, put your three cards in order:

The first card determines who you were, and gives you a name. Write the name or
something that evokes it on a sheet of paper: this will be your character sheet
for the game. Describe who you were, and why you decided to get on this colony
ship to begin with. What were you leaving behind? What were you hoping for? The
descriptions are purposefully vague, but be obvious in how you detail them.
Your obvious is different from everyone else’s.

The second card determines what you have. Write it under your name, with a
circle divided into six wedges: this is a clock. When the wedges are filled,
you no longer have this. Describe what it is and why you have it. When people
start talking about their plans, think about how this might be helpful.

The third card determines what you want. Write it under your name, to remember
it. Think about how you might go about getting it. Describe what it means to
this character, and why they might want it. Fill out the details and share
them: the players should know much more than the characters.

== Act II: The Council Meeting
image::img/planetfall-bw.png[]

Once the players understand the context, the facilitator should present them
with the problem that’s drawn them together: the ship’s power was never meant
to sustain the colony, and the replicators won’t last forever. Every use from
now on drains a limited power supply (a common resource with an 8-clock), and
nobody here knows enough to say when it will run out.  Ask them for ideas to
solve this problem, and then step back and let people talk.

When characters declare their intention to do something after the meeting,
write it down on their own character sheet, with four bullets after. These
plans will be resolved in the aftermath. Any character may offer a bargain to
another’s plan to give them a die: if accepted, write down what was offered
next to a bullet.

As the council meeting dies down, the facilitator should push everyone to have
at least one plan for after the meeting, and then adjourn it.  Sooner is better
than later -- if there’s a long silence, end it.

== Act III: The Shadows
image::img/salvage.png[]

Each player has the opportunity to call a scene. They must include their own
character, but may also include up to three other characters in the game. They
choose the place and time and anyone not involved spectates. Characters may
declare plans and make bargains in the shadows just like during the council
meeting. The facilitator shouldn’t let these go too long, either -- if they
don’t seem to be going anywhere, fade out.

== Act IV: The Aftermath
image::img/harvest.png[]

Take all the characters’ name cards, shuffle them up, and place them face-down
on a table. You’ll go through this deck resolving plans until there are none
left.

Draw the top character and ask their player to choose one of their plans to
resolve. As facilitator, you may make one last devil’s bargain to that player,
which is far less constrained than the ones made by characters. It still only
grants one die. The player rolls a six-sided die for each offer accepted and
looks for the highest number rolled to determine success:

On a 1-3, the plan fails. On a 4-5, it succeeds at a cost. On a 6, it succeeds.

The lowest number determines the cost to each bargained resource -- each player
should tick down resources they supplied to that plan. Write down the results
of these plans as they’re resolved. If that character has more plans to
resolve, shuffle them back into the deck. Otherwise, pull them out.

If you want to play another session, deal out new characters to any who need
one. Act I shifts slightly to figuring out what the colony looks like after
these things happen.

== The basics
This is a story about the survivors of a fallen colony ship. One of you plays
as Gaia, with her eyes and ears on the planet itself, its flora and fauna, and
the colony. The rest of you play colonists, hoping to survive together.

You play _Exile_ in two-act sessions: *the council* and *the contact*. The
first act is a free-form council meeting where players can make plans. The
second act is a montage of those plans coming to fruition, with resources and
dice deciding how each turns out.

Before the first session is a special prologue: planetfall. Each player rolls
dice to restrict their character options, and Gaia (the facilitator player)
chooses a playbook that describes where they've fallen.

=== The game

_Exile_ isn’t quite a "game" in the normal sense — nobody’s attempting to win,
and losing a character doesn’t make you lose or anything. It’s more like a
structured way to play pretend. We hand the reins of the experience over to
Gaia, and the other players build characters to control like they’re piloting a
mech suit.

The nice thing about this is that we can avoid the old cops and robbers
argument of "I shot you!" "No, you didn’t!" because someone’s in charge of
deciding what happens at any given point. It’s not that much fun to always just
decide, though, so we’ll often push it off to the dice. The dice don’t feel as
bad when things go poorly, so that’s a bonus. Stories where only good things
happen are seldom interesting.

Another nice thing about playing with a group of creative people is that nobody
has to come up with everything themselves. Creativity is draining, especially
building a whole world up from nothing. Sometimes you can make someone else
create, or use the rules and tables in this book (TODO) to prompt you.

=== No secrets

There are no secrets between players in _Exile_. Either everyone at the table
knows, or nobody knows. Hard and fast rule.

This means no character backstory that doesn’t emerge from play. It means no
building a world map on your own and then springing it on the other players. It
means don’t write up the alien planet bird-watching book and consult it when
someone looks outside.

It also means you can’t have secret plans that only you and Gaia know about,
springing them on the others only after completion. Air those things out,
folks.

*However,* plans are only known to the characters participating in them by
default. If Bird goes off and finds the birdmech hangar, and Whip gave them her
way into the ship, only Bird and Whip know about it. Either of them can
certainly tell everyone else in the colony if they like, but players should be
able to separate their own knowledge from their character's.

== Planetfall

image:boarding.png[]

Ten thousand colonists left Earth for this class-M planet. Probes have been
here in orbit for decades mapping the surface, just like every other colony.
The colony ship dropped in to orbit the planet safely while supplies and people
were dropped off, but something happened to it and now you're here a little
early.

Your ship lies in a heap of wreckage, somewhere on the planet, and you have to
build up a colony without many of the safeguards sent with you. You also have
the crew of the colony ship, who never wanted to stay.

=== Character creation
Three rolls -- each 2d6 with a light and a dark die -- constrain your character
decisions. You get to decide which result goes in which slot, but that's it.

.Dark die for the row, light die for the column
|===
|2d6 |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6
|1 |Rider |Clover |Ship |House |Tree |Cloud
|2 |Snake |Coffin |Bouquet |Scythe |Whip |Bird
|3 |Kid |Fox |Bear |Star |Stork |Dog
|4 |Tower |Garden |Mountain |Crossroad |Mouse |Heart
|5 |Ring |Book |Letter |Adam |Eve |Lily
|6 |Sun |Moon |Key |Fish |Anchor |Cross
|===

The first slot is who you were. It determines your character's family name
(though you decide what people call you) and what made you decide to board this
ship. Each result leaves enough room for you to add detail; describe to the
other players why you had to leave Earth.

The second slot is what you kept hold of -- or found -- during planetfall.
These are 6-clock resources that you begin play with.

The third slot is what you want. Try and angle your way towards this in play.
If you feel like you've got it, score a point and pick a new goal.

== Act I: The council

image:salvage.png[]

You are the leaders of the most powerful factions in the colony, gathered
together to try to keep everyone alive while you build a foundation on this
planet. At the first council, you sit under a lean-to made of wreckage, at a
makeshift table, on whatever you could drag over. Perhaps later it'll be more
comfortable.

****
The planet was surveyed long before you got there, to ensure it was a safe
place for a new colony. Unexplored, yes. Wild, sure. But the atmosphere and
geology aren't actively out to destroy you yet. It feels like Earth, back in
the years before the industrial revolution.

You've still got trouble, though. The ship was supposed to prepare a space for
you where the surveyor drones decided a colony would be most prosperous, but it
never got a chance. You were supposed to land with food and water stores for a
decade, but they're scattered across the landscape. Experts in all the skills
necessary for building a new civilization were among the crew, but many of them
are dead.

Instead, you have human ingenuity and lots of help. You have whatever salvage
you can pull from the wreckage. You have a planet full of life that you might
tame.
****

In each council act, find a comfortable space to talk. You can wander around,
in and out of earshot of the other players. You can sit together at a large
table or gather in small groups in a backyard. Each player should carry their
resources (as cards or tokens or a list) and something for recording plans.

During the council, players should try to solve problems: their own, their
faction's, and the colony's. Some of these might be solved just through
discussion, but most will need to happen after the meeting is over. For the
latter, you must make a *plan*.

=== Best laid plans
There are six types of plan:

Explore:: write down where you're looking and what you hope to find. On a hit,
you'll find it: write it down on the map. It's not a resource, though it may be
a place you can gather resources from. On a 4-5, pick one. On a 6, pick two.
On a critical, pick three.

- It's easy to defend.
- It's sheltered from the weather.
- It's well-stocked.
- It's beautiful.
- Nobody/nothing else was there.

Gather:: write down what you're collecting, and where from. Be specific -- you
can't gather hovercraft from the ship without exploring to find the hangar. On
a hit, you'll get a resource for what you collected. On a 4-5, draw a 4-clock.
On a 6, draw a 6-clock. On a critical, draw an 8-clock. Choose one:

- You describe an upside, Gaia describes a downside.
- You describe a downside, Gaia describes an upside.

Build:: write down what you're building, where you're building it, and what
materials you're using. The latter must be resources. On a hit, add your
building to the map. You control it. On a 4-5, Gaia adds something dangerous
nearby. On a critical, Gaia adds something helpful nearby.

Intervene:: write down what you're trying to prevent, and how. On a hit,
describe how you reduce the effect of Gaia's threat. On a 6, Gaia can't bring
that threat to bear this round. On a critical, Gaia can't bring it to bear
until after another Council phase.

Repair:: write down what you're trying to fix, and how. On a hit, reduce that
thing's stress clock. On a 4-5, reduce it by one tick. On a 6, by two ticks. On
a critical, by three ticks.

Assault:: write down what you're trying to control, and how far you're willing
to go. On a hit, you'll take control of it and can do what you like with it.
On a 4-5, draw a 4-clock. When it fills up, you lose control of it.

.Example plans
====
Lily: Explore the ship, hoping to find the armory.

Anchor: Gather a small group of engineers from the colony.

Bird: Intervene to prevent the fuel containment from failing, by removing the fuel.
====

When you make a plan, announce it to the people around you and write it down.
Let them know whether this is a secret plan (that is, whether they _know_
you're planning it) or whether it's public. _Exile_ is better when the players
know more than the characters: this leads to some great dramatic irony and
foreshadowing.

After you make a plan, you should consider asking Gaia for position & effect.
(See https://bladesinthedark.com/action-roll for background.) This can give you
an idea of how many resources you're going to need to make it work. You can only
use a resource with the permission of the person who will have it at the time
you resolve your plan. You might ask for permission first, to be safe. Write it
down as a bullet under your plan.

.Example resources
====
Lily: Explore the ship, hoping to find the armory.

- Anchor's way into the ship

Anchor: Gather a small group of engineers from the colony.

- Lily's manifest

Bird: Intervene to prevent the fuel containment from failing, by removing the fuel.

- Anchor's engineers (hopefully)
====

== Act II: The contact

image:harvest.png[]

When the council ends, Gaia will choose a player to begin.  When you're chosen,
choose one:

- Resolve one of your plans.
- Catch a break and (optionally) cancel an unresolved plan.

Then choose a player who hasn't been chosen yet this round, including Gaia.
Once everyone has been chosen once, start another round by choosing anyone
(again, including Gaia) unless the players are all out of plans. In that case,
the session ends. Continue with another session, starting with the Council act,
if you have time.

=== Resolution
Choose one of your plans and announce it to the group, along with all the
bullets you wrote down.

Each relevant resource you can use for your plan can either give you a die or
stress you out if it doesn't show up. Key word: relevant. If you're looking to
repair the radio, it's highly unlikely that your diving gear will help. It's up
to Gaia to decide whether a resource is relevant.

For each resource you named, ask its owner to choose:

- You can use it, take a die.
- You can't use it, take a stress.

At this point you'll have a (possibly empty) pool of dice. You can add another
die to your pool by pushing yourself (add yourself to the resources for your
plan) or accepting a Devil's Bargain. (See
https://bladesinthedark.com/action-roll.)

Then, you roll the pool.

- The highest die determines how well the plan goes, as described in the plans
  section. If it's a 4+, you hit. Otherwise, you miss.
- The lowest die determines the stress you put on your resources, divided as
  evenly as you can among them. You choose what takes the extra stress, though
  you can't give it to something whose clock is already full. When a stress
  clock fills, it breaks. (TODO: Resource trauma.)

=== Downtime
TODO: Stress relief as a way of detailing the world (#2)

== The ship

image:planetfall-bw.png[]

TODO: Name it?

The ship has a playbook kind of like Gaia's, with the same 5-level pyramid
(this time with "the colony" pre-added at the top, perhaps). Exploration wishes
along the side for things that the ship had, to be crossed off when Gaia says
you can't find them permanently. Buildings can go on this pyramid based on
their distance from the colony, with habitat info in the area.

== The planet

TODO: Name it?

Gaia also gets to make plans, but must announce them early and always gets last
initiative. [Think of Gaia's plans like the Grind in Torchbearer.]

Three possible playbooks for Gaia:

- The Wine Dark Sea (Subnautica-detailed ocean)
- City of Brass (ancient ruins of an alien city)
- Green Light (forest canopy, miles above the surface)

Playbooks would have threat moves and sorta be like an adventure starter.
Player exploration triggers Gaia's advancement (like the Cave in Vast), and the
playbook holds a food chain (as a 5-level pyramid) with space for habitat
details (on the left and right on each level, chosen from a list for each
playbook).

City of Brass might end up with cyborg rodents somewhere in the middle, with a
sewer habitat linked to its level. Gaia doesn't name the flora / fauna, they
describe them and ask a player (whose character saw them) for a name.

A player's exploration plan must have a hope: something you really would like
to find. Lots of meat? A farm-able plant? A safe place to camp? The roll
decides whether or not you find it, and what the downsides are.

Gaia adds the results to the food chain / habitat map (perhaps on a 1-3 they
add whatever they want, on a crit they add exactly what the plan hoped for, and
on a 4-5 or 6 they add the plan's hopes plus some additional thing). As the map
fills up, Gaia advances, perhaps gaining access to new threats or moves.
(Perhaps they can only add a predator if it's supported by food underneath, and
habitats upwards as well.)

When the map fills up (or when players decide to strike out across the land?),
exploration allows Gaia to add a new playbook -- the players have gone far
enough out to find another biome.

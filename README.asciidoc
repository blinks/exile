== The basics
_Exile_ is a narrative-heavy game about a crashed colony ship that you play in
two-act sessions: *the council* and *the contact*. The first act is a free-form
council meeting where players can make plans. The second act is a montage of
those plans coming to fruition, with resources and dice deciding how each turns
out.

Before the first session is a special prologue: planetfall. Each player is
dealt cards to restrict their character options, and Gaia (the facilitator
player) chooses a playbook that describes where they've fallen.

== Planetfall
Ten thousand colonists left Earth for this class-M planet. Probes have been
here in orbit for decades mapping the surface, just like every other colony.
The colony ship dropped in to orbit the planet safely while supplies and people
were dropped off, but something happened to it and now you're here a little
early.

Your ship lies in a heap of wreckage, somewhere on the planet, and you have to
build up a colony without many of the safeguards sent with you. You also have
the crew of the colony ship, who never wanted to stay.

=== Character creation
Three cards randomly dealt from a Lenormand deck constrain your character
decisions. You get to decide which one goes in which slot, but that's it.

The first slot is who you were. It determines your character's family name
(though you decide what people call you) and what made you decide to board this
ship. Each card leaves enough room for you to add detail; describe to the other
players why you had to leave Earth.

The second slot is what you kept hold of -- or found -- during planetfall.
These are 6-clock resources that you begin play with.

The third slot is what you want. Try and angle your way towards this in play.
If you feel like you've got it, score a point and pick a new goal.

.Three example characters
====
Lily has [Bouquet] the ship's manifest and wants [Bear] control of the colony.

Anchor has [Key] a way into the ship and wants [Dog] a loyal population.

Bird has [Clover] a liquor stash and wants [House] safety for the colony.
====

== Act I: The council
You are the leaders of the most powerful factions in the colony, gathered
together to try to keep everyone alive while you build a foundation on this
planet. At the first council, you sit under a lean-to made of wreckage, at a
makeshift table, on whatever you could drag over. Perhaps later it'll be more
comfortable.

****
The planet was surveyed long before you got there, to ensure it was a safe
place for a new colony. Unexplored, yes. Wild, sure. But the atmosphere and
geology aren't actively out to destroy you yet. It feels like Earth, back in
the years before the industrial revolution.

You've still got trouble, though. The ship was supposed to prepare a space for
you where the surveyor drones decided a colony would be most prosperous, but it
never got a chance. You were supposed to land with food and water stores for a
decade, but they're scattered across the landscape. Experts in all the skills
necessary for building a new civilization were among the crew, but many of them
are dead.

Instead, you have human ingenuity and lots of help. You have whatever salvage
you can pull from the wreckage. You have a planet full of life that you might
tame.
****

In each council act, find a comfortable space to talk. You can wander around,
in and out of earshot of the other players. You can sit together at a large
table or gather in small groups in a backyard. Each player should carry their
resources (as cards or tokens or a list) and something for recording plans.

During the council, players should try to solve problems: their own, their
faction's, and the colony's. Some of these might be solved just through
discussion, but most will need to happen after the meeting is over. For the
latter, you must make a *plan*.

=== Best laid plans
There are six types of plan:

- Explore: write down where you're looking and what you hope to find. If you
  succeed, you'll get to reveal something useful on the map.
- Gather: write down what you're collecting, and where from. If you succeed,
  you'll get a resource for what you collected.
- Build: write down what you're building, where you're building it, and what
  materials you're using. If you succeed, you'll get to add that building to
  the map. 
- Intervene: write down what you're trying to prevent, and how. If you succeed,
  you'll reduce or eliminate the effect of Gaia's threat.
- Repair: write down what you're trying to fix, and how. If you succeed, you'll
  turn back that thing's stress clock.
- Assault: write down what you're trying to control, and how far you're willing
  to go. If you succeed, you'll take control of it and can do what you like
  with it.

.Example plans
====
Lily: Explore the ship, hoping for weapons.

Anchor: Gather a small group of engineers from the colony.

Bird: Intervene to prevent the fuel containment from failing, by removing the fuel.
====

When you make a plan, announce it to the people around you and write it down.
Let them know whether this is a secret plan (that is, whether they _know_
you're planning it) or whether it's public. _Exile_ is better when the players
know more than the characters: this leads to some great dramatic irony and
foreshadowing.

After you make a plan, you should consider asking Gaia for position & effect.
(See https://bladesinthedark.com/action-roll for background.) This can give you
an idea of how many resources you're going to need to make it work. You can only
use a resource with the permission of the person who will have it at the time
you resolve your plan. You might ask for permission first, to be safe. Write it
down as a bullet under your plan.

.Example resources
====
Lily: Explore the ship, hoping for weapons.

- Anchor's way into the ship

Anchor: Gather a small group of engineers from the colony.

- Lily's manifest

Bird: Intervene to prevent the fuel containment from failing, by removing the fuel.

- Anchor's engineers (hopefully)
====

== Act II: The contact
When the council ends, Gaia will take everyone's name cards and shuffle them
together. These will be drawn to determine what order players get to resolve
plans.

When your card is drawn, choose one:

- Resolve one of your plans.
- Catch a break and (optionally) cancel an unresolved plan.

After all cards are drawn, Gaia will make a move, then shuffle them all back up
for another round unless the players are all out of plans. In that case, the
session ends. Continue with another Council act, if you have time.

=== Resolution
Choose one of your plans and announce it to the group, along with all the
bullets you wrote down. Confirm your position & effect with Gaia, then ask
about your resources.

Each relevant resource you can use for your plan can either give you a die,
improve your position, or improve your effect. Key word: relevant. If you're
looking to repair the radio, it's highly unlikely that your diving gear will
help. It's up to Gaia to decide whether a resource is relevant.

For each resource you named, ask its owner to choose:

- It gives you a die.
- It improves your position.
- It improves your effect.
- You can't use it.

At this point you'll have a position, an effect, and a (possibly empty) pool of
dice. You can add another die to your pool by pushing yourself (add yourself to
the resources for your plan) or accepting a Devil's Bargain. (See
https://bladesinthedark.com/action-roll.)

Then, you roll the pool.

- The highest die determines how well the plan goes. (See
  https://bladesinthedark.com/action-roll.)
- The lowest die determines the stress you put on your resources, divided as
  evenly as you can among them. You choose what takes the extra stress, though
  you can't give it to something whose clock is already full. When a stress
  clock fills, it breaks. (TODO: Resource trauma.)

=== Downtime
TODO: Stress relief as a way of detailing the world (#2)

== The ship
TODO: Name it.

== The planet
TODO: Name it.

Three possible playbooks for Gaia:

- The Wine Dark Sea (Subnautica-detailed ocean)
- City of Brass (ancient ruins of an alien city)
- Green Light (forest canopy, miles above the surface)

Playbooks would have threat moves and sorta be like an adventure starter.
Player exploration triggers Gaia's advancement (like the Cave in Vast), and the
playbook holds a food chain (as a pyramid) with space for habitat details (on
the left and right on each level).

City of Brass might end up with cyborg rodents somewhere in the middle, with a
sewer habitat linked to its level. Gaia doesn't name the flora / fauna, they
describe them and ask a player (whose character saw them) for a name.

A player's exploration plan must have a hope: something you really would like
to find. Lots of meat? A farm-able plant? A safe place to camp? The roll
decides whether or not you find it, and what the downsides are.

Gaia adds the results to the food chain / habitat map (perhaps on a 1-3 they
add whatever they want, on a crit they add exactly what the plan hoped for, and
on a 4-5 or 6 they add the plan's hopes plus some additional thing). As the map
fills up, Gaia advances, perhaps gaining access to new threats or moves.
(Perhaps they can only add a predator if it's supported by food underneath, and
habitats upwards as well.)

When the map fills up (or when players decide to strike out across the land?),
exploration allows Gaia to add a new playbook -- the players have gone far
enough out to find another biome.
